# Resend MCP server

Send email and manage Resend domains, audiences and broadcasts from an agent.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http resend https://mcp.resend.com/mcp
```

**Any MCP client** (`mcpServers` config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "resend": {
      "url": "https://mcp.resend.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## What it can do

- Send email
- Manage domains, contacts and audiences
- Create and send broadcasts

## Notes

Locally: `claude mcp add resend -e RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxx -- npx -y resend-mcp`. An agent that can send mail should ask before every send.
