# n8n workflow builder MCP server

Node documentation, validation and templates for n8n, so an agent can design and deploy working workflows.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add n8n-mcp -e MCP_MODE=stdio -- npx n8n-mcp
```

**Any MCP client** (`mcpServers` config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "n8n-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "MCP_MODE": "stdio"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What it can do

- Look up any n8n node's properties and operations
- Validate a workflow before it runs
- Create and update workflows on your instance (with API access)

## Notes

`MCP_MODE=stdio` is required for desktop clients. A hosted version runs at dashboard.n8n-mcp.com.
