# Stripe MCP server

Stripe's hosted server: customers, products, prices, payment links, invoices and the Stripe docs.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http stripe https://mcp.stripe.com
```

**Any MCP client** (`mcpServers` config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stripe": {
      "url": "https://mcp.stripe.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## What it can do

- Create and look up customers, products and prices
- Create payment links and invoices
- Search the Stripe documentation

## Notes

Connect a test-mode account first. Anything it does in live mode moves real money.
