# Notion MCP server

Search, read and edit Notion pages and databases through the Notion API.

## Install

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add notion -e NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_xxxx -- npx -y @notionhq/notion-mcp-server
```

**Any MCP client** (`mcpServers` config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notion": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "NOTION_TOKEN": "ntn_****"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What it can do

- Search the workspace
- Read and update pages and blocks
- Query and edit databases

## Notes

The integration only sees pages you share with it. Notion also runs a hosted remote server; issues with that one go to Notion support.
