# 2_Agents: subagent definitions

Installable agent definitions in the Claude Code subagent shape: a markdown file whose
frontmatter carries `name:` and `description:` (and usually `tools:` and `model:`), followed by
the agent's system prompt. Drop one into `.claude/agents/` and it loads.

Since 2026-10-21 this section holds **only** real definitions. The 456 role-play and
"act as X" prompts that used to live here were removed (git history keeps them); a prompt that
is not an installable agent belongs in `4_Prompts`.

## Provenance

Every file carries an `upstream:` block (`scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs --agents`): 71 `exact`,
6 `similar`, 9 `unknown` (our own). Sources: `VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents` (36),
`davila7/claude-code-templates` (22), `github/awesome-copilot` (17), `wshobson/agents` (2). The
Monday drift check compares the `exact` and `similar` ones with their upstream and the Saturday
roadmap job resyncs drifted ones (`scripts/resync-upstream.mjs 2_Agents/<path>`).

## Adding one

The Catalog Refresh job adds up to 4 a run from permissively licensed collections. By hand:
copy the file, keep its frontmatter, run `node scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs --agents --write`
and `node scripts/backfill-tags.mjs --write` from the repo root, then rebuild the index.
