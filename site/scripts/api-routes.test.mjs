/**
 * The dev server and the Vercel function must expose the same API.
 *
 * They stopped doing that once: server.ts kept a hand-written copy of every
 * prompt route, and the copy quietly lost `lightweight`, never gained
 * `GET /api/prompts/:id`, and filtered the GitHub tree on a folder that had
 * been renamed. Both now serve the app exported from api/index.ts, so this
 * check just pins the route table — if a handler is dropped or renamed, this
 * fails before anyone notices in the browser.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:routes   (from site/)
