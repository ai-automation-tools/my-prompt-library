## 2026-10-23 — Docs caught up with the audit fixes

**Docs**
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: the status badge is now Phase 2, and the note records which audit items are done (F01–F03, F05–F07, F13) and what is next (F08). F09 and F20 note their progress so far.
- `SECURITY.md` lists today's protections: read-only hiding My Library, the Host and Origin check, and checked, atomic, conflict-aware writes. Its CI line names the new tests.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the PR template ask for every `npm run test:*` script, not just `test:routes`.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describes how the UI handles a failed prompt load and a save conflict.

_Touched: `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — Saves can't half-write a file or overwrite a newer edit

**Changed**
- My Library replaces a file by writing a temp file in the same folder and renaming it over the original, so a crash or a full disk mid-save leaves the old prompt whole.
- Every My Library prompt carries a `version`, a hash of the file on disk. The editor sends back the version it opened. If the file changed in the meantime (another tab, an agent over MCP, or a text editor, which `updated` alone would miss), the save is refused with `409`. The editor then reloads with the saved text and says so, instead of silently overwriting it. MCP `update_my_prompt` takes the same optional `version`, and `get_item` shows it. Roadmap item F07.
- Adding a skill pack is all or nothing: if one skill fails, the ones that request already wrote are deleted, so a retry starts clean.

**Added**
- `scripts/my-library.test.mjs`:
  - two stale writers (the first save wins);
  - a hand edit that leaves `updated` alone;
  - an injected rename failure (old file intact, no temp left);
  - the HTTP `409` and its `current`;
  - a pack install that fails on its second skill (nothing left behind, and the retry adds each skill once).
- `scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs` checks a stale `version` is refused.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/API.md` documents `version`, the `409` and the all-or-nothing pack install; `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/setup/SETUP.md` follow.

_Touched: `site/lib/my-library.ts`, `site/api/index.ts`, `site/api/skill-packs.ts`, `site/mcp/server.ts`, `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/src/components/PromptCard.tsx`, `site/scripts/my-library.test.mjs`, `site/scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — Downloaded prompts are valid markdown files

**Fixed**
- The Download button built the file's frontmatter by pasting values into a template. A title containing `: ` made the YAML invalid. Tags came out as one comma-separated string, a missing subcategory as the word `None`, and every other frontmatter key was dropped, so a downloaded My Library skill lost the `name` and `description` it needs to load. Now `src/lib/markdown-file.ts` writes each value as JSON, which YAML reads as-is. The skill's own keys come first, and the body follows unchanged. Roadmap item F06.
- Download file names no longer start with dashes when a title opens with an emoji.

**Changed**
- `GET /api/prompts/:id` returns `extra`, the file's frontmatter beyond the standard fields, for both libraries.

**Added**
- `scripts/markdown-file.test.mjs` (`npm run test:markdown-file`, in CI) downloads four awkward prompts and reads each back through the My Library store unchanged: colons, quotes, a newline in the title, emoji tags, a body containing `---`, and a skill with `name`, `description`, `license`, `allowed-tools` and nested `metadata`.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/API.md` documents `extra`. `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md` and `docs/setup/SETUP.md` list the new test and file.

_Touched: `site/src/lib/markdown-file.ts`, `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/src/components/PromptCard.tsx`, `site/api/index.ts`, `site/scripts/markdown-file.test.mjs`, `site/package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — My Library writes check their fields

**Changed**
- Every My Library write is checked in one place, the store's `create` and `update`, so the HTTP routes, the MCP tools, copies and pack installs all apply the same rules. Title and category must be non-blank text, section one of the six library folders, subcategory text or null, tags a list of up to 50 non-blank strings, content non-blank and at most 500 KB. Limits sit well above anything in the Public Library. A refused write changes no file and comes back as `400` naming the field (an error result over MCP). Roadmap item F05.
- An empty `content` (or title) on an update is now refused. Before, the store's `||` reported success and quietly kept the old body.

**Fixed**
- Objects, numbers and unknown sections no longer reach the frontmatter on disk.

**Added**
- `scripts/my-library.test.mjs` covers 14 bad creates, 5 bad updates (file unchanged), a Unicode round trip and the HTTP `400`s; `scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs` checks `update_my_prompt` refuses an empty body.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/API.md` has a field-rules table and the new `400`s; `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` point at the shared check.

_Touched: `site/lib/my-library.ts`, `site/api/index.ts`, `site/scripts/my-library.test.mjs`, `site/scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — A prompt that fails to load is not opened from its preview

**Fixed**
- When a prompt's full text could not be loaded (server error, network failure, bad response), the app fell back to the listing copy, which is a 200-character preview for My Library and nothing for the Public Library. Edit then opened on the preview, and saving wrote it over the real file. Download and card Copy reported success with the preview or an empty body, and the detail page opened on the preview, so its Copy did too. Now each shows an error and stops: the editor stays shut, nothing is downloaded or copied, and the page you were on stays put. Roadmap item F03.

**Added**
- `scripts/prompt-content.test.mjs` (`npm run test:prompt-content`, in CI) checks that `fetchFullPrompt` throws on 503, 404, a network failure, invalid JSON and a missing body, and returns a 5,000-character body whole.

**Docs**
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md` and `docs/setup/SETUP.md` list the new test; `AGENTS.md` describes the fail-closed fetch.

_Touched: `site/src/hooks/usePromptContent.ts`, `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/scripts/prompt-content.test.mjs`, `site/package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — One Host and Origin check in front of every route

**Security**
- The local server refuses a request whose `Host` is not `localhost`, `*.localhost`, an IP address or a name in `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, on every route: the API, skill packs, and the pages in both `npm run dev` and `npm start`. A page that rebinds its own domain to `127.0.0.1` (DNS rebinding) can no longer read My Library. Until now only Vite checked Host, and only for pages in dev. Vercel skips the check. Roadmap item F02.
- The cross-site `Origin` check moved out of `requireWritable` into the same middleware and now covers every write, so skill-pack add and remove refuse other sites too instead of relying on `READ_ONLY` and `confirm`. Roadmap item F13.

**Changed**
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` now applies to the API and `npm start` as well as the dev server, and takes `.suffix` entries for subdomains, like Vite.

**Added**
- `scripts/my-library.test.mjs` covers foreign Hosts on reads, writes and packs, the trusted names, and cross-site versus same-origin pack add and remove. It fails with the middleware removed.

**Docs**
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `site/.env.example`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/features/API.md` describe the Host and Origin checks and the wider reach of `ALLOWED_HOSTS`. `AGENTS.md` lists all five optional settings.

_Touched: `site/api/index.ts`, `site/scripts/my-library.test.mjs`, `site/.env.example`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — Read-only mode keeps My Library private

**Fixed**
- With `READ_ONLY` set (or on Vercel), the server no longer serves My Library: `GET /api/prompts?library=my` returns an empty list, a My Library id on `GET /api/prompts/:id` is not found, and `GET /api/skill-packs?library=my` lists no packs. Writes were already refused; reads were not, so a server exposed read-only as `docs/setup/SETUP.md` suggests could hand out a personal library. Roadmap item F01. The MCP server is unchanged: over stdio, read-only still reads My Library.

**Added**
- `scripts/read-only.test.mjs` (`npm run test:read-only`, in CI): seeds a private prompt in a temp folder, checks the three routes hide it and that public list, detail, skill download and packs still work. It fails with the guards removed.

**Docs**
- `docs/setup/SETUP.md` says `READ_ONLY` means Public Library only, instead of implying it shares My Library read-only. `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md` and `docs/setup/DEPLOYMENT.md` describe the closed reads and list the new test.

_Touched: `site/api/index.ts`, `site/api/skill-packs.ts`, `site/scripts/read-only.test.mjs`, `site/package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/setup/DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — The audit's findings are on the roadmap

**Docs**
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` gains **Phase 2: Audit fixes**, from the 2026-10-23 audit (health 6.4/10, no P0): read-only mode hiding My Library (F01), one Host/Origin check including pack writes (F02, F13), failing closed when a prompt body cannot load (F03), shared write schemas, lossless export, atomic conflict-aware writes, modal focus, MCP hint and clipboard fixes, CI build and contract tests, required checks on `main`, symlink-safe paths, demo headers and stale setup claims. Loose ends becomes Phase 3 and gains strict TypeScript (F11) and endpoint budgets (F12).
- Findings that matched an existing item were merged into it: the Resources menu (F16), the history secret scan (F10, now run, with 138 candidates left to triage), provenance (F17), source and freshness badges (O02), export/import (O01) and placeholder arguments (O03). Evaluation export (O04) is new.

_Touched: `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-10-23 — A Favorites button in the sidebar

**Added**
- A **Favorites** row tops the sidebar's category list, set off by a thin rule, in every section but Skill Packs and in both libraries. Its count and the view it opens cover the starred prompts in the current section and library, sorted by title, laid out like a category page with a "Favorites" breadcrumb.

_Touched: `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`._

## 2026-10-22 — The MCP write tools can import a local file

**Added**
- `save_to_my_library` and `update_my_prompt` take `file`: the absolute path of a local `.md` file the server reads, so an agent can save or refresh a long `SKILL.md` without retyping it into the call. The file's frontmatter is kept; `content` becomes a preface above it.
- `IMPORT_ROOTS` lists the folders `file` may read. Unset, `file` is refused; outside paths, junctions that resolve outside, non-markdown and files over 500 KB are refused too. Covered in `scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs`.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md` and `docs/mcp-server.md` describe `file` and `IMPORT_ROOTS`, and count four write tools, not three.

_Touched: `site/mcp/server.ts`, `site/scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs`, `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`._

## 2026-10-22 — My Library copies know their public source

**Added**
- Saving a Public Library item records `forked_from` (its id) and `forked_hash` (its content as copied) in the copy's frontmatter, from the site and from `save_to_my_library`.
- A copy whose public version has changed shows an **Update from public** banner on its page; `POST /api/prompts/:id/pull-upstream` and the MCP tool `update_from_public` replace the copy's body with the current public one. If the copy was edited too, the site asks first. The public file is only ever read.
- `GET /api/prompts/:id` returns `upstream` for My Library items, and MCP `get_item` notes a changed public version. Copies saved before today have no `forked_from` and are matched by section, category, subcategory and title.
- The My Library detail page has an Edit button.

**Changed**
- The edit button is the plain pencil (`Pencil`) instead of lucide's `Edit`, which is the pencil-in-a-square "compose" glyph.

_Touched: `site/lib/my-library.ts`, `site/api/index.ts`, `site/mcp/server.ts`, `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/src/components/PromptCard.tsx`, `site/src/components/PromptDetail.tsx`, `site/scripts/*.test.mjs`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/features/API.md`, `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`._

## 2026-10-22 — The README links the MCP setup page

**Docs**
- The root README links to `docs/mcp-server.md`, the one page with the install line for each client, so the MCP setup is one click from the repo's front page.

## 2026-10-22 — The MCP server and package are named promptbook

**Changed**
- The MCP server id is now `promptbook` (`serverInfo.name` in `site/mcp/server.ts`, the install lines in
  `README.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, the homepage and the server's own card). An install under the old
  `my-prompt-library` id keeps working until you re-add it as `promptbook`; tool names become `mcp__promptbook__*`.
- The card moved from `6_MCP_Servers/Developer_Tools/my-prompt-library.md` to `promptbook.md`, so its old
  `?prompt=` link no longer resolves.
- `site/package.json` is named `promptbook`; Skill Packs carry `"author": "promptbook"`
  (`scripts/build-skill-packs.mjs` and the pack docs follow); the GitHub API scripts send `promptbook-*` user agents.
  `AGENTS.md` and the bug template name the `promptbook-demo` host.
- Kept on purpose: the `my-prompt-library.theme` / `.palette` localStorage keys, so saved preferences survive.

_Touched: `site/mcp/server.ts`, `site/package.json`, `site/package-lock.json`, `site/library/`, `site/api/prompt-index.json`, `scripts/`, `homepage/index.html`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/`._

---

## 2026-10-22 — A failed chunk load no longer blanks the app

**Fixed**
- Opening a prompt could turn the whole page black: a stale Vite dep cache made the lazy
  `PromptDetail` chunk fail to import (`504 Outdated Optimize Dep`), and with no error boundary
  React unmounted everything. The five lazy views now load through `lazyReload()`, which reloads
  the page once on a failed chunk. It also covers an open demo tab whose chunks a new deploy replaced.
  Troubleshooting entries added to the Debug Guide and SETUP.
- Opening any of the 21 generated Skill Packs also went black: they have no `use_cases` or
  `prerequisites`, and the pack view read `.length` on both. `SkillPacksView` now defaults
  every optional array when it loads a pack.

_Touched: `site/src/App.tsx`, `site/src/components/SkillPacksView.tsx`, `docs/development/DEBUG_UI.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`._

---

## 2026-10-22 — Library refresh — catalog

**Added**
- MCP cards (`6_MCP_Servers/Cloud_Platforms/`), install lines read from each README on 2026-10-22:
  `mongodb.md` (mongodb-js/mongodb-mcp-server, Apache-2.0) and `neon.md` (neondatabase/mcp-server-neon, MIT).
  Databases had no card before.
- Discovery intake, three `accept` rows set to `done`:
  - DietrichGebert/ponytail (MIT, ref `09c434ab`): `ponytail`, `ponytail-audit`, `ponytail-debt`,
    `ponytail-gain`, `ponytail-help`, `ponytail-review` → `3_Skills/Development/Engineering/`.
  - tt-a1i/archify (MIT, ref `25cf3708`): `archify` (SKILL.md, LICENSE, references/) → `3_Skills/Design/archify/`.
    The 18 MB of scripts, renderers and examples were left out.
  - K-Dense-AI/scientific-agent-skills (MIT, ref `593377bb`): `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`, `pymc`, `shap`,
    `seaborn`, `networkx` → `3_Skills/Data/`.
- No system prompts or agent definitions: no new vendor-published system prompt found that is not already here,
  and no installable agent definition was added this run.

---

## 2026-10-22 — The app is addressed as promptbook-demo

**Changed**
- Every link to the hosted app now names `https://promptbook-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev`, including
  `PUBLIC_SHARE_ORIGIN` in `site/src/App.tsx`, so new share links use the new host. The homepage, its
  404 redirect, the README, `SECURITY.md` and the docs follow. `my-prompt-library-demo.` still serves
  the same Vercel project, so old share links keep working.

_Touched: `site/src/App.tsx`, `scripts/homepage.test.mjs`, `homepage/`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/`._

---

## 2026-10-22 — Org layout: AGENTS.md and the MCP page

**Changed**
- The repo guide moved from `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md`, which Codex, Gemini CLI and opencode read.
  `CLAUDE.md` is now `@AGENTS.md` plus a note on `.mcp.json`. Links in `docs/README.md` and
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` follow it.

**Added**
- `docs/mcp-server.md`: the MCP server on one page (entry file, launch, stdio transport, all eleven
  tools, the MCP prompts, env var names, the install line), linked from the docs hub. The design
  stays in `features/MCP-SERVER.md`.

_Touched: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/mcp-server.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-22 — Library refresh — prompts and agents

**Agents** (synced to `davila7/claude-code-templates` @ `5bbe5a7`, MIT, `match: exact`):
`task-decomposition-expert`, `hackathon-ai-strategist`, `model-evaluator`, `llms-maintainer`,
`ai-ethics-advisor` (all `ai-specialists/`), `computer-vision-engineer` (`data-ai/`).

**Prompts** (model names checked against
[Anthropic's models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview),
[OpenAI's models page](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models) and
[Google's Gemini models page](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models); stamped `checked: 2026-10-22`):
- `AI_ML/Claude_Code/claude-advanced-reasoning.md`: Claude 3.5 Sonnet → Claude Sonnet 5.5.
- `Business/Marketing/claude-seo-keyword-chain.md`: Claude 3.5 Sonnet → Claude Sonnet 5.5.
- `Business/Ecommerce/business-plan-prompts.md`: GPT-4 / Claude 3 / Gemini Advanced → Claude Sonnet 5.5 / GPT-6.1 Sol / Gemini 3.8 Flash.

## 2026-10-22 — Renamed to Promptbook

The GitHub repo moved from `ai-automation-tools/my-prompt-library` to
`ai-automation-tools/promptbook`, and the product's display name is now **Promptbook**.

**Changed**
- Every GitHub link points at `ai-automation-tools/promptbook`; the homepage is
  `promptbook.ai-automation-tools.dev` (canonical, `og:url`, `CNAME`, `scripts/homepage.test.mjs`).
- The name reads "Promptbook" in the README, docs, homepage (title, headings, meta and og tags),
  the app's page title, top bar and footer, the MCP server's instructions and its own library card,
  the diagram titles, the logo proposals in `images/`, `SECURITY.md` and `NOTICE`.
- Clone instructions now `cd promptbook/site`, matching the folder `git clone` creates.

**Kept, on purpose**
- Identifiers: the MCP server id `my-prompt-library` (and its `mcp__my-prompt-library__*` tool
  names and config examples), the npm package name, the Vercel project, env var names, API
  routes, localStorage keys, file and folder names, and the Skill Pack `author` field.
- The demo stays on `my-prompt-library-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev` until a `promptbook-demo`
  record exists.

## 2026-10-21 — Tailscale access documented; stopping the app spares the MCP server

Reviewed alongside the logon auto-start and `tailscale serve` set up earlier the same day
(#395 added `ALLOWED_HOSTS`).

**Checked, no conflict**
- The start task now also runs at logon and kept its exact path, so the daily sync's
  stop-and-restart entry for this repo still matches it.
- Port 3010 is served to the tailnet only (no Funnel), proxied to `127.0.0.1:3010`; the server
  still binds loopback. Through both tailnet hostnames the page and API answer `200`; a write
  with a foreign Origin is refused `403`, a same-origin one passes the guard.

**Fixed (outside this repo)**
- `Stop-Prompt-Library` ended every process in `site/node_modules`, which includes this
  library's MCP server in every Claude Code session using it. The Routines fleet's
  `Invoke-AppControl.ps1` now excludes processes naming `mcp/server.ts` and their children.
  Tested with a connected session through a real stop and start: the MCP server kept
  answering throughout.

**Docs**
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is in the settings tables of `README.md` and `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, and
  `SETUP.md` has an "Over Tailscale" section: the `tailscale serve` command, the
  `ALLOWED_HOSTS` line, and the fact that every tailnet device can edit My Library unless
  `READ_ONLY=true`.

_Touched: `README.md`, `docs/setup/SETUP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`; outside the repo, `Invoke-AppControl.ps1`._

## 2026-10-21 — Docs brought level with the day's changes

**Docs**
- `docs/DIRECTION.md` moved to `docs/audits/DIRECTION-2026-08-27.md` with a "historical" note:
  it explained the post-audit plan of August (accounts, Neon, GitHub mode), which the local-first
  rewrite and today's new roadmap replaced. Its links were fixed for the new folder.
- `docs/README.md`: the index lists the discovery ledger and `UPSTREAMS.md` instead of
  Direction, and the tree shows `DISCOVERY.md`, `UPSTREAMS.md`, the MCP Servers template and
  `features/MCP-SERVER.md`.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the `README.md` tree: `lib/library.ts`, `site/mcp/`,
  `6_MCP_Servers/`, `resources.json`, the MCP test, and the six repo scripts added this month.
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: the folder tree has `6_MCP_Servers/`, and `2_Agents/` says
  installable subagents only. The templates README and summary describe the agents template as
  subagent definitions rather than personas and list the MCP Servers template.
  `3_Skills/README.md` describes `2_Agents` the same way.
- Every relative link in the touched docs resolves; `homepage.test.mjs` passes.

_Touched: `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/audits/DIRECTION-2026-08-27.md` (moved), `docs/templates/README.md`, `docs/templates/TEMPLATE-SUMMARY.md`, `site/library/3_Skills/README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — My Library keeps a skill's frontmatter

Found by testing the MCP server for real: a Claude Code session created a prompt and a skill in
My Library, then the skill was edited.

**Fixed**
- `lib/my-library.ts` rewrote a file's whole frontmatter on every save from the seven keys it
  manages, so **any edit dropped a skill's `name` and `description`**, and a skill without them
  does not load. This hit the app's editor too, not only the MCP server. Unmanaged keys now
  live in a new `extra` field: read from the file, written back first (a skill still opens with
  `name:`), and kept through updates.
- Copying from the Public Library dropped them as well: the copy route, Skill Pack installs and
  the MCP server's `save_to_my_library` passed only the body. They now carry the item's own
  frontmatter, less provenance (`upstream:`) and the keys My Library manages
  (`carriedFrontmatter()` in `lib/library.ts`).
- `get_item` returns a My Library skill as a complete SKILL.md, frontmatter included.

**Tests**
- `test:my-library`: a skill keeps `name` and `description` through an update, and the file
  starts with `name:`. `test:mcp`: a skill created with frontmatter survives an edit and
  read-back, and a copied Public Library skill keeps its `name`. With the fix removed, both
  suites fail.
- Re-run through Claude Code: the skill created in the first test was edited and still reads
  back with its `name` and `description`, on disk and through `get_item`.

## 2026-10-21 — The MCP server stays current with everything else

The server runs straight from this clone (it is in Mike's user-scope Claude Code config), so
anything that leaves the clone stale breaks it in every session.

**Found and fixed**
- The daily repo sync never reinstalled `node_modules` for this repo. It only acted on a
  root-level `package-lock.json` changing, and only for read-only mirrors; this repo's lockfile
  is `site/package-lock.json` and it syncs through `mike_desktop`. `Sync-Repos.ps1` (outside
  this repo) gains an opt-in `$repoInstallDirs` map with `my-prompt-library = site`: a pulled
  change to that lockfile now stops the local app and any `node` process rooted in the repo,
  runs `npm ci` in `site/`, checks the tree, and restarts the app. The repo also gets the
  `$repoServiceTasks` row the hub asks of any repo that runs a dev server. Exercised once
  against the real repo: `npm ci` ran, the app came back, the build and `test:mcp` passed.

**Tooling**
- `npm run test:mcp` now also fails if `SECTIONS` in `lib/library.ts` and `src/lib/sections.ts`
  list different folders, so a new library section cannot ship without the server knowing it.
  Proved by renaming one folder: the test failed with that message.
- The item count in the server's instructions is read from the index at start-up instead of
  being written into the code.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md` gains "How it stays current": what keeps the content, the clone,
  `node_modules`, the SDK and the server's own card current, and what CI checks.
- `README.md` links the MCP Server doc from its Features quick links; `docs/UPSTREAMS.md` lists
  the MCP SDK and zod so the biweekly upstream check covers majors and spec revisions;
  `CLAUDE.md` notes the section rule.

## 2026-10-21 — The library is an MCP server

_Phase 1: MCP server for the library._ An agent can now search the library and use what it
finds directly: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or any MCP client, over stdio, with nothing else
running.

**App**
- `site/mcp/server.ts` (`npm run mcp`), on `@modelcontextprotocol/server` 2.3, the v2 SDK line;
  `serveStdio()` serves 2026-era and 2025-era clients from one factory. Eleven tools:
  `search_library`, `get_item`, `list_sections`, `list_categories`, `get_skill`,
  `get_skill_file`, `list_skill_packs`, `get_skill_pack`, and the My Library writes
  `save_to_my_library`, `update_my_prompt`, `delete_my_prompt`, which are not registered at all
  when `READ_ONLY` is set. MCP prompts: `library_prompt` for any id, plus every featured prompt
  and every My Library prompt by name.
- `site/mcp/setup.ts` loads first and keeps stdout for the protocol: `console.log`, `info` and
  `debug` go to stderr, and `.env` loads with dotenv's `quiet` flag (dotenv 17 prints to stdout).
- `site/lib/library.ts` is new and shared: the library path, the section keys, the index loader
  and `readLibraryItem()`. `GET /api/prompts/:id` and the copy route now use it instead of their
  own copies; `getAllPacks()` is exported from `api/skill-packs.ts` for the server.
- Every caller path goes through `resolveInside()`. Support files are refused over 500 KB or
  when binary.

**Tests and CI**
- `npm run test:mcp` (`scripts/mcp-server.test.mjs`) spawns the server over real stdio with the
  SDK client: all eleven tools, the prompts, six traversal attempts, a My Library round trip in
  a temp folder, and read-only mode. A deliberately broken containment check made it fail, so
  the guard is covered. It never echoes what a broken guard returns. New CI step "MCP server".
- Checked by hand: three launch commands complete the handshake, and a Claude Code session with
  the README's config called `search_library` and got skill ids back.

**Docs**
- `docs/features/MCP-SERVER.md` (design and tool contracts), a README section with install lines
  and the tool table, the server's own card in `6_MCP_Servers/Developer_Tools/` (20 cards now),
  a homepage feature card (in place of the theme card) and install block, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/README.md`.
- Roadmap: seven Phase 1 items ticked. The MCP-prompts item was built differently from its
  wording (featured and My Library prompts plus one generic prompt, not all ~2,200), and
  placeholder-to-argument parsing became its own item under Later.

**Dependencies**
- Added `@modelcontextprotocol/server` and `zod`; `@modelcontextprotocol/client` as a dev
  dependency for the test. `npm audit` still reports four moderate advisories, all in
  `gray-matter`'s old `js-yaml` chain, which predate this change.

## 2026-10-21 — Roadmap rewritten; Phase 1 is an MCP server for the library

**Docs**
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` rewritten from scratch in the lab roadmap standard. The finished history,
  the Snapshot table and the "Earlier work" essay are gone; this changelog is the record of
  everything done before today.
- **Phase 1: MCP server for the library**, at Mike's request. A stdio server in this repo
  (search, get, browse, skills and packs, library prompts as MCP prompts, My Library writes
  that respect `READ_ONLY`), each step with the test that proves it; then a read-only remote
  endpoint on the demo, an npm package and an MCP registry listing, which are Mike's calls.
- **Phase 2: Loose ends.** Node 24, the Resources menu below 1536px, per-section hero counter
  labels, semantic duplicates, and four decisions waiting on Mike (a stale branch, the
  Awesome ChatGPT corpus, a `LICENSE` for `agent-skills`).
- Public release keeps its three done gates and one open one, the full-history secret scan.
- After release: content provenance, three features (starter collections, generated vs
  hand-picked packs, My Library export and import), and a launch post. Dropped as obsolete:
  user ratings (there are no accounts) and "programmatic API access" (the MCP server is that).
- A "Kept current by" table says which scheduled job owns which part of the library.
- `CLAUDE.md` no longer points at a roadmap item that is gone. The weekly roadmap job's prompt
  (Routines fleet) now walks whatever phases the file has instead of a fixed Phase 1–3 list.

_Touched: `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — MCP Servers section, 2_Agents holds real agents only, first discovery triage

**Content**
- New section **MCP Servers** (`site/library/6_MCP_Servers/`, tab `mcp-servers`, indigo accent).
  19 cards in five folders: the six reference servers (Filesystem, Fetch, Memory, Sequential
  Thinking, Git, Time), Playwright and Chrome DevTools, GitHub, Context7, MarkItDown and REA,
  Supabase, Cloudflare and AWS, Notion, n8n-mcp, Resend and Stripe. Each card names the
  maintainer, licence, transport and auth, with install lines for Claude Code and for any
  `mcpServers` client, all read from the server's own README today. Four are `featured`.
  Template: `docs/templates/mcp-servers-template.md`.
- **`2_Agents` now holds only installable subagent definitions.** The 456 files without `name:`
  frontmatter (role-play personas and "act as X" task prompts) are deleted; git history keeps
  them. 86 definitions remain, all with provenance. Section README rewritten; the agents
  template now starts from the subagent frontmatter.
- **Discovery triage.** All 28 ledger rows decided: 9 `accept` (skill collections with a
  licence, for the Catalog Refresh), 6 `link`, 10 `reject` (apps, agent harnesses, a
  CAPTCHA-bypass scraper, a leaked-prompt dump), 3 `done` (Context7, Chrome DevTools and REA
  became MCP cards).
- Resources menu: the six `link` rows added (four under Skills, two under Agents & MCP).
- Index: **2,795 entries** (3,192 − 456 agents + 40 skills from the first Skills Sync + 19 cards).

**Tooling**
- `scripts/check-mcp-servers.mjs` flags cards whose repo is missing, renamed, archived,
  relicensed, quiet for a year, or not re-read in 90 days. The Monthly Upkeep runs it.
- `scripts/discover-repos.mjs` links only `link` rows into the Resources menu now; accepted
  repos show up in the library itself.
- `scripts/backfill-tags.mjs` knows the new section (`mcp-server`).

**App**
- `sections.ts`, the tab type, the path filter and the per-section tokens (`--sec-mcp`, 400/700
  indigo) carry the seventh section. The top-bar section buttons fold into the sheet below
  **1360px** (was 1280px), the width seven buttons need.
- Running text keeps acronyms when it lower-cases a section name (`lowerLabel()`), so the page
  says "All MCP servers", not "All mcp servers".
- Homepage: "Six library sections" with an MCP Servers card; the Agents card describes what is
  there now.

_Touched: `site/library/2_Agents/**`, `site/library/6_MCP_Servers/**`, `site/library/resources.json`, `site/src/` (sections, route and filter hooks, index.css, App, LibraryHero, TopBar), `scripts/{check-mcp-servers,discover-repos,backfill-tags}.mjs`, `docs/` (DISCOVERY, ROADMAP, ARCHITECTURE, README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, two templates), `homepage/index.html`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `site/api/prompt-index.json`._

## 2026-10-21 — Skills refresh, generated Skill Packs, repo discovery, a data-driven Resources menu

Four more pieces of the library's upkeep move from "someone should" to a script.

**Tooling**
- `scripts/sync-agent-skills.mjs` now **refreshes** as well as adds: a skill already stamped
  from `ai-automation-tools/agent-skills` whose upstream body moved gets its body and support
  files re-mirrored, local frontmatter kept, `ref`/`checked` bumped (`UPDATED` lines, own
  changelog bullet). The Monday Skills Sync job runs it, so the org's skills are both pulled in
  and kept level without waiting for the drift issue.
- `scripts/build-skill-packs.mjs` generates one pack per `3_Skills` folder with **6 or more
  skills** (`generated: true`, name and description read from each SKILL.md), rewrites only
  generated packs, removes one whose folder shrank, and with `--write` drops dead paths from the
  hand-written packs. First run: **20 generated packs** beside the 6 hand-written ones (Content,
  Data, Design, Security, Cloud, Git, Mobile, CI/CD, Blockchain, Web, SME, Development root,
  AI/ML, Business, Marketing, Enterprise Communications, Finance, Investing, Portfolio
  Management, Platform Integrations). A second run changes nothing.
- `scripts/discover-repos.mjs` searches GitHub (`gh search repos`, eleven queries across skills,
  prompts, agent definitions and MCP servers) for repos that are **new** (under a year old,
  500+ stars) or **popular** (5000+), skips everything the library already tracks (`upstream.repo`
  stamps, `docs/UPSTREAMS.md`, the Resources menu, the ledger), and appends the top 25 by stars
  to **`docs/DISCOVERY.md`** as `pending` rows with licence and last push. A person flips a row
  to `accept`, `link` or `reject`; the script links `accept`/`link` rows into the Resources
  menu, the Catalog Refresh job vendors `accept` rows with provenance. Leaked-prompt dumps are
  filtered out before they reach the ledger. The ledger starts with the three repos Mike named.
- The **Resources** menu reads `site/library/resources.json` (six groups, icon names resolved in
  `ResourcesNav.tsx`) instead of a hard-coded array, so scripts and jobs can add or drop a link.
  `scripts/check-resources.mjs` probes every link and reports the dead ones; its first run found
  Learn Prompting's system-prompts page gone (repointed to its prompt-structure page). The org's
  own `agent-skills` repo is now the first link under Skills.
- `site/tsconfig.json`: `resolveJsonModule`.

_Touched: `scripts/{sync-agent-skills,build-skill-packs,discover-repos,check-resources}.mjs`, `site/library/resources.json`, `site/library/3_Skills/packs/**` (20 new), `site/src/components/ResourcesNav.tsx`, `site/tsconfig.json`, `docs/DISCOVERY.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — AX Platform content retired

The library was first built alongside the AX Platform agent-coordination tool, which is no
longer in service. Everything that only made sense with it is gone; prompts that mentioned it in
passing now read generically.

**Content**
- Removed (10 files, 3 of them whole folders): the `AX Platform Agent` persona
  (`2_Agents/Platform_Agents/Ax-Platform_Dev/`), the `ax-workspace-cookbook` skill
  (`3_Skills/Platform_Integrations/AX_Workspace_Cookbooks_SKILL/`), the `AX MCP Server Prompts`
  collection (`4_Prompts/Engineering/AX-Platform/`), the `AX Platform Workspace Task` Claude Code
  prompt, the three AX-specific Claude Cowork prompts (changelog draft, MCP updates newsletter,
  competitor intel), and the duplicate copies of the pricing-model and agent-spec prompts that
  were written "for AX Platform".
- Genericised (17 files): the surviving `Pricing Model Builder` and `Agent Spec Generator`
  prompts now target `[your product]` / "your agent platform"; eight Claude Cowork prompts say
  "my product" or "my stack" instead of AX Platform; the `siem_cve_workflow` skill drops the three
  `mcp__ax-platform__*` tools from `allowed-tools` and stores artifacts as "shared context"; the
  OpenClaw MCP setup guide loses its AX batch-auth block; two Build_Apps prompts lose the
  `projects/ax-platform/` path; the section READMEs for Agents and Skills no longer list it.
- Index: **3192 prompts** (was 3202).

_Touched: the files above, `site/api/prompt-index.json`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — Every library section gets a job, and 430 files get tags

Until today the content automations grew `4_Prompts` only (two prompts a week), skills and
Skill Packs had no intake at all, and the two refresh passes each ran once a month. The fleet
in `~\.claude\Routines` now covers every section, one lane per job, and the repo carries the
scripts the model-free parts run on.

**Content**
- `scripts/backfill-tags.mjs` gives any indexed file with no `tags:` path-derived tags
  (section, category, subcategory). Run once: **430 files** tagged (241 skills, 162 agents, 21
  prompts, 6 system prompts) that the tag filter and ⌘K could not see. Text-level insert of one
  line (or a prepended block for files with no frontmatter), so the drift check's body
  comparison and the skill-frontmatter test are unaffected. The Monthly Upkeep re-runs it.
- `scripts/sync-agent-skills.mjs` copies every skill in the org's `ai-automation-tools/agent-skills`
  that `3_Skills` does not hold into the matching category, stamped with `title`, `tags` and an
  `upstream:` block (`match: exact`) so the drift check tracks it from then on. Adds only. The
  Routines fleet runs it Mondays with no Claude session (`Prompt-Library Skills Sync`); 40 skills
  are waiting for the first run.
- The six duplicate pack JSONs under `3_Skills/Development/` are gone: `api/skill-packs.ts` reads
  `3_Skills/packs/` only, and these copies had drifted from the real ones.

**Tooling**
- `check-upstream-drift.mjs` adds a **Library health** table to the Monday issue: per section,
  files, changed in the last 30 days, untagged, and (skills, real agents) without provenance.
- Fleet changes, in the Routines repo: the Library Refresh split into a **Guides Refresh**
  (alternate Tuesdays) and a **Catalog Refresh** (alternate Thursdays) so each lane runs twice a
  month; Add Prompts adds **1 guide** a week beside its 2 prompts; the Monthly Upkeep checks every
  Skill Pack's paths and adds one pack a month, keeps `featured` within per-section caps, and
  keeps the untagged count at zero.

_Touched: `scripts/{backfill-tags,sync-agent-skills,check-upstream-drift}.mjs`, 430 files under
`site/library/`, `site/api/prompt-index.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`; deleted
`site/library/3_Skills/Development/*-pack.json`._

## 2026-10-21 — Section buttons in the top bar

**UI**
- The six section links are bordered buttons now; the current one fills with its section's hue
  (rose, cyan, violet, amber, emerald, teal) instead of an underline. Each gets its icon from
  1536px up. The Resources menu and the brand wordmark move to the same wide-window gate so the
  bar never overflows beside the categories panel; the ⌘K trigger is icon + keys only.

_Touched: `site/src/index.css`, `site/src/components/{TopBar,ResourcesNav}.tsx`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — Settings dialog with colour palettes

**UI**
- A Settings button (gear) in the top bar, also reachable from ⌘K. The dialog holds Appearance
  (the Light | Dark mode and a colour palette), Local data (clear favourites and recently viewed)
  and the keyboard shortcuts.
- Four palettes on top of the mode: Sky (the org default), Violet, Emerald and Ember, after the
  retired Midnight Violet, Emerald Glass and Carbon Ember themes. Each swaps only the accent (400
  shade dark, 700 light) and in dark tints the ground a hair toward the hue; surfaces, text and
  lines stay the house set. Stored as `my-prompt-library.palette` and applied before first paint.

## 2026-10-21 — The app on the org house style

The app now wears the same chrome as ai-automation-tools.dev (the `web-house-style` skill):
the sections sit in the top bar as nav links with a sliding underline, the categories panel is
the sidebar, and the theme is a Light | Dark pill at the right end of the bar.

**UI**
- Top bar rebuilt as the house document-page bar: categories toggle, the app icon as the brand,
  the six sections as links (a sheet under the bar below 1280px, opened by a menu button), then
  ⌘K, Resources, New prompt and the theme switch. Breadcrumbs moved above the content, shown
  once you are inside a category.
- The 16-theme picker is gone. Dark is the default whatever the OS says; light is opt-in from the
  switch and remembered as `my-prompt-library.theme`, applied in `index.html` before first paint so
  a light-mode reload never flashes dark. The light set is the house light block (sky-700 accent,
  section hues at their 700 shade so text in them passes contrast on white).
- `index.css` carries the full house token set (dark on `:root`, light on `html.light`); every rule
  below the token blocks references tokens only. `themes.css` deleted.
- The constellation canvas and the two drifting glows are gone: one static glow behind the top of
  the page, nothing else lit at rest.
- A footer row at the end of the content (GitHub, Homepage, ai-automation-tools.dev, Cookie
  settings), a skip link, and the phone pass: 16px fields, 36–40px tap targets, no sideways scroll
  at 390px.
- ⌘K keeps a Light / Dark pair under Themes instead of sixteen entries.

## 2026-10-21 — Dev server's HMR socket pinned to 24678

**Tooling**
- `server.ts` runs Vite in middleware mode, which opens its hot-reload WebSocket on a port of its
  own. It was left to Vite's default, so another middleware-mode app on the machine (edge-spectrum)
  could take it first and leave this one without HMR. `site/vite.config.ts` now pins it to `24678`
  explicitly (edge-spectrum moved to `24679`); `DISABLE_HMR=true` still turns it off.

_Touched: `site/vite.config.ts`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — Neon deleted, Vercel env vars cleared

**Ops**
- The Neon project behind the old accounts is deleted, closing the never-rotated credential that
  had been scrubbed from history. The `my-prompt-library` Vercel project no longer holds
  `DATABASE_URL` or the GitHub-mode variables. Verified on the live demo after the #383 deploy:
  writes return 403, `/api/auth/me` is 404, and the UI has no library switch or sign-in.

_Touched: `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-21 — Local-first: no accounts, My Library on disk, a read-only demo

The plan changed from a public site where people sign up and keep prompts, to an app people clone
and run themselves. A personal library doesn't need a server-side account, and running signups
meant owning a login system, a database and their security for no benefit to anyone.

**App**
- My Library is now a folder of markdown files, one per prompt, with title, section, category,
  subcategory, tags and dates in frontmatter (`site/lib/my-library.ts`). It defaults to
  `site/my-library/` (gitignored); `MY_LIBRARY_DIR` points it at a synced or git-tracked folder.
  Every My Library route kept its shape, so the UI's create, edit, delete, copy and skill-pack flows
  are unchanged apart from the sign-in prompts disappearing.
- Removed: email/password accounts (bcrypt, cookie sessions, rate limiting, the login and signup
  modals, `AuthContext`), the Neon/Postgres layer and its four tables, and GitHub mode, which the
  Vercel deployment never had switched on. Dependencies `pg`, `bcryptjs`, `cookie-parser`,
  `express-rate-limit` and their types are gone.
- Skill packs: a pack counts as in My Library while any prompt there carries its
  `skill-pack:<id>` tag, so the separate install table went with the database.
- The server listens on `127.0.0.1` (`HOST` overrides), since anyone who can reach it can edit My
  Library, and every write refuses a request whose `Origin` doesn't match its `Host`, so a page on
  another site can't post a form into it. `npm start` now builds and serves `dist/`; it used to run a `dist/server.js` nothing built.
- Read-only mode: `READ_ONLY=true`, or automatically on Vercel. Write routes return 403 and the UI
  hides the library switch, New prompt, Save to My Library and pack add/remove. The demo at
  `my-prompt-library-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev` is now a read-only Public Library browser.

**Tooling**
- `npm run test:my-library` round-trips the file store in a temp folder, checks that ids can't
  name a path outside it and that cross-site writes are refused; CI runs it, and the existing
  `lib/safe-path.test.mjs`. `test:routes` now also fails if an auth router comes back.
- The data-flow diagram swaps the Neon node for the `my-library/` folder, re-pinned to the new code.

**Docs**
- README, CLAUDE.md, SECURITY.md, setup, deployment, API, architecture, UPSTREAMS, the homepage and
  the roadmap describe the local-first app. `docs/features/GITHUB_MODE.md` and
  `docs/development/POSTGRES-MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md` were deleted. The roadmap's Neon items became one:
  delete the database and the dead Vercel env vars (Mike).

_Touched: `site/` (api, lib, server, src, scripts, package files, `.env.example`, `vite.config.ts`),
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/` (README,
ROADMAP, DIRECTION, UPSTREAMS, ARCHITECTURE, setup, features, skill-packs, diagrams),
`homepage/index.html`, `homepage/diagram/`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-20 — Quick Start says where to run npm

**Docs**
- The README's Quick Start now states that the app lives in `site/` and every `npm` command runs
  there. Running `npm install` from the repo root from an existing clone did nothing but leave an
  empty `package-lock.json`.

_Touched: `README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-19 — Two API-lifecycle prompts

Two new original prompts in `site/library/4_Prompts/Development/Api_Design/`, a folder that held one
misfiled debugger prompt.

- **API Breaking Change Review** — classifies each contract difference as breaking, risky or safe from the
  consumer's side, including the silent ones (new nullable fields, new enum values, changed defaults).
- **API Deprecation and Sunset Plan** — a dated retirement plan with `Deprecation`/`Sunset` headers,
  brownouts, and a usage-based go/no-go for shutdown.

`site/api/prompt-index.json` rebuilt to include them.

---

## 2026-10-19 — A code-pinned data-flow diagram on the homepage

**Docs**
- New `docs/diagrams/library-data-flow.json`: an Archify data flow of how library markdown becomes the
  prebuilt index the public API serves, how My Library and skill-pack installs reach Neon, and what the
  React app fetches. Every node cites the code it describes at a pinned commit; `docs/diagrams/README.md`
  is the procedure.

**Site**
- The homepage's "How it works" section embeds the interactive diagram live
  (`homepage/diagram/`, copies the builder writes), in the page's theme.

**Tooling**
- `scripts/build-diagram.mjs` builds it and checks for drift (`--check`); CI's *Diagram drift* step warns
  when cited code changes, and the weekly doc drift check reads `--check` as `prompt-library-diagram`.

_Touched: `docs/diagrams/`, `scripts/build-diagram.mjs`, `homepage/index.html`, `homepage/diagram/`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-19 — The app moves to `my-prompt-library-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev`

The bare host becomes the static homepage in `homepage/`, so everything that names the running app
now points at the `-demo` host.

**App**
- `PUBLIC_SHARE_ORIGIN` in `site/src/App.tsx` is `https://my-prompt-library-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev`,
  so new share links go straight to the app. Old ones still work through the homepage's forwarding.

**Docs**
- README (logo link, View Demo, badge), CLAUDE.md, SECURITY.md, `docs/README.md`, the live-site line in
  `docs/ROADMAP.md`, the `curl` examples in `docs/skill-packs/README.md` and the bug-report template
  name the new host. Changelog history and the done roadmap item keep the old one.

_Touched: `site/src/App.tsx`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`,
`docs/skill-packs/README.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-19 — A static homepage in `homepage/`

**Site**
- New top-level `homepage/`: a single-file house-style page (amber accent, the app's own icon
  colour; dark default, Light | Dark switch, source bar, consent script) for
  `my-prompt-library.ai-automation-tools.dev`, with `favicon.svg`, `CNAME` and `.nojekyll`. Its
  "Open the library" button points at the app's new host, `my-prompt-library-demo.ai-automation-tools.dev`.
- Old app links keep working once the bare host serves the homepage: `404.html` forwards any
  non-root path to the app host, and `index.html` forwards a root URL that carries the app's
  share-link query (`library`, `section`, `prompt`, `category`, `subcategory`).
- `.github/workflows/homepage.yml` publishes `homepage/` to GitHub Pages on a push to `main`
  that touches it. The Vercel app (Root Directory `site/`) is unaffected.
- `scripts/homepage.test.mjs` pins the page's required links; CI runs it.

_Touched: `homepage/*`, `.github/workflows/homepage.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
`scripts/homepage.test.mjs`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-19 — Roadmap on the lab standard

**Docs**
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` takes the lab roadmap shape. No existing item is added, dropped or
  re-ticked: the centred header, Now / Next / Then as Phases 1 to 3 (Then is done), a new
  `## 🚦 Public release` checklist (four gates the repo already meets, ticked, and one open:
  a full-history secret scan), and the Later groups, the maintenance cadence and the
  earlier-work summary under `## After public release`. Wrapped items are one line each, the
  strike-through on done items is gone, and the items that need Mike (the Neon rotation, the
  real `DATABASE_URL`, the two "decide" items) carry `🔒 Needs Mike`. The `\r\n` in the
  line-endings item, which had been written as a literal line break, is restored.

_Touched: `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-17 — Provenance for agents, and the last unstamped skill

The weekly drift check now covers the subagent definitions in `2_Agents`, not just skills.

**Agents**
- `scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs --agents` runs the same body / prefix / shingle / name matching
  over `2_Agents` files with `name:` frontmatter, against clones of VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents,
  github/awesome-copilot, wshobson/agents and davila7/claude-code-templates. The last of those
  re-ships most of the others' agents, so it is consulted last and only credited where it is the
  sole source. Each mode reads and stamps only its own section.
- All 86 agent definitions are stamped: **71 `exact`** (36 VoltAgent, 17 awesome-copilot, 16
  claude-code-templates, 2 wshobson), **6 `similar`** by name (claude-code-templates has since
  rewritten them), **9 `unknown`** (no public source; ours). The 460 role-play prompts are untouched.

**Drift tooling**
- `check-upstream-drift.mjs` walks `2_Agents` too and resolves an agent by file name (`x.md`,
  `x.agent.md`) where a skill resolves by directory. Agent rows keep their `2_Agents/` prefix.
- `resync-upstream.mjs` accepts those `2_Agents/….md` paths (local frontmatter, upstream body,
  no support files), and now also accepts a skill path ending in `/SKILL.md`, which is how the
  report prints skills.
- `upstream.test.mjs` checks the `match:` vocabulary across agents as well as skills (409 stamped files).

**Skills**
- `Data/scholar-evaluation` was the one skill with no `upstream:` block. Stamped `similar` to
  K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills, which has since rewritten it.

First combined drift run: 171 checked, 163 current, 7 `behind` (`scholar-evaluation` and six
agents: `task-decomposition-expert`, `hackathon-ai-strategist`, `model-evaluator`,
`llms-maintainer`, `ai-ethics-advisor`, `computer-vision-engineer`), 1 `drifted`
(`x-twitter-scraper`, 1%). None were resynced here; that is the drift job's call.

_Touched: `scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs`, `scripts/check-upstream-drift.mjs`,

## 2026-10-14 — `prompts.mikesailab.com` decommissioned

The org domain is now the only home. Share links (`PUBLIC_SHARE_ORIGIN` in `src/App.tsx`) point
at `my-prompt-library.ai-automation-tools.dev`, and the old `prompts.mikesailab.com` and `prompts.ax-platform.com` hosts are
detached from the Vercel project.

## 2026-10-13 — Library refresh — guides

First guides pass. Nine guides under `site/library/1_Guides/` read against the vendors' own
docs and corrected; each gets `checked: 2026-10-13`. Two duplicate stubs merged away.

- **`Claude_Code/flags-reference.md`**, **`slash-commands.md`**, **`claude_code_cli_guide.md`** →
  code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference, `/commands`, `/setup`, `/permission-modes`. Added the
  new commands and flags (`--bg`, `--bare`, `--safe-mode`, `claude attach|logs|stop|doctor|install`,
  `/goal`, `/background`, `/subtask`, `/cd` …), the full permission-mode list (`auto`, `dontAsk`),
  `--effort` levels, `--cloud` (`--remote` deprecated). Removed the false `--api-key` flag and
  `/pr-comments`, `/vim` (removed upstream). The CLI guide wrongly called npm install deprecated;
  it is a supported method, so all install routes are now listed.
- **`Codex/flags-reference.md`**, **`slash-commands.md`** → github.com/openai/codex and the Codex
  CLI command reference (now at learn.chatgpt.com/docs/developer-commands). New install
  commands, `codex update|review|fork|login|doctor|sandbox`, `--sandbox`, `--ask-for-approval`,
  `--yolo`, `--oss`, `-c`. Dropped the retired `gpt-5.x` model list (no default is stated) and the
  `GEMINI_CLI=1` line that had been pasted into the Codex pages. **Slash-command list not
  re-verified:** the official slash page redirects to a page that does not list them; a note says so.
- **`Gemini_CLI/flags-reference.md`** → github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli `docs/cli/cli-reference.md`.
  The page had no CLI-flag section; added the full options table, subcommands and model aliases
  (`auto`, `pro`, `flash`, `flash-lite`); removed the unsupported `gemini auth login` and the
  retired model list; `/memory refresh` → `/memory reload`.
- **`API_Providers/anthropic_api_guide.md`** → platform.claude.com models overview. Model IDs now
  `claude-fable-5-1`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `claude-haiku-5-5`; 1M context,
  128K output, adaptive thinking and `effort`. **Merged** `anthropic-api-guide.md` (a 370-byte
  stub) into it and deleted the stub.
- **`API_Providers/openai_api_guide.md`**, **`openai-api-best-practices.md`** → developers.openai.com/api/docs/models.
  `gpt-5.6-sol` (not a listed model) → `gpt-6.1-sol` / `gpt-6-astra` / `gpt-6-luna`, 1.05M context,
  Responses API. **Merged** `openai-api-guide.md` (stub) into `openai_api_guide.md` and deleted it.

Not touched: `docs/features/API.md` still uses the deleted `anthropic-api-guide.md` path as an
example id (outside this job's scope). Remaining unchecked guides are for the next guides pass.
Counts in `1_Guides/README.md` are unchanged.

_Touched: the nine guides above, two deleted stubs, `site/api/prompt-index.json`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`._

## 2026-10-13 — Phone polish

An audit at 390×844 found no horizontal overflow (the sidebar is already a drawer), so the
fixes are small and scoped to phones or touch, leaving desktop untouched.

- Form fields render at 16px below `md`, so iOS Safari no longer zooms the page when the
  search, category filter, palette or login/signup fields are focused (they were 12.5–15px).
- Touch targets below `md`: icon buttons get a 36px minimum (card actions were 28px),
  `.btn-sm` and the segmented control go from 30px to 36px, and the source-bar link fills
  the bar's height.
- The app shell uses `100dvh` after `100vh`, so the bottom of the layout isn't hidden
  under mobile browser toolbars. On desktop `dvh` equals `vh`.
- Card actions stay visible on touch tablets: `md+` with `hover: none` used to hide them
  behind a hover that can't happen.

## 2026-10-12 — Three skills resynced; drift report clean (#339)

The 2026-10-12 drift comment on #339 listed `brainstorming` as `behind` and `claude-api` as
`drifted`; `x-twitter-scraper` had moved again upstream by the time they were fixed. All three
resynced with `scripts/resync-upstream.mjs`; local frontmatter (title, tags, category) kept.

- **`Content/brainstorming`** → `obra/superpowers` @ `bb92a77`. Upstream rewrote the skill
  since the 2026-10-05 sync (97% of its lines new). `spec-document-reviewer-prompt.md` is gone
  upstream and was pruned; `builder-check-prompt.md` is new.
- **`Development/API/claude-api`** → `anthropics/skills` @ `dbd4588`, 96 files. Four new
  Managed Agents quickstarts (`bug-hunter`, `explainer-video-maker`, `performance-tuner`,
  `watchlist-scanner`) plus updates across `shared/` and the language folders.
- **`Business/Marketing/x-twitter-scraper`** → `xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper` @ `ef87f44`.

Scanned the incoming files for email addresses and case collisions: none. A fresh run of
`check-upstream-drift.mjs` reports **93 of 93 tracked skills `current`**. Index rebuilt.

## 2026-10-12 — Dependabot alerts: two patched, one not reachable

- **`proxy-addr` 2.0.7 → 2.0.8** (critical, IP spoofing via IPv4-mapped IPv6 trust subnets;
  via `express`) and **`source-map-js` 1.2.1 → 1.2.2** (high, event-loop DoS; via
  `@tailwindcss/node` and `postcss`). Lockfile-only `npm update`, no range changes. The app
  sets `trust proxy` to a hop count, not a subnet, so the spoofing path was not open here.
- **`sprintf-js` (moderate) has no fixed release.** It arrives through `gray-matter` →
  `js-yaml@3` → `argparse@1`, and `argparse` is required only by js-yaml's CLI entry
  (`bin/js-yaml.js`), which the app never loads. Alert dismissed as *vulnerable code not used*.
- **ROADMAP:** queued *Record provenance for the untracked skills and the real agent
  definitions*, so the weekly drift check covers all of `3_Skills` and the installable part
  of `2_Agents`.

## 2026-10-12 — Live on `my-prompt-library.ai-automation-tools.dev`

The app joins the org domain, following the `<repo-name>.ai-automation-tools.dev` convention.
The Vercel project now carries both hosts; `prompts.mikesailab.com` still serves the same
deployment (no redirect yet).

- **Source bar** (`src/components/SourceBar.tsx`, `.src-bar` in `index.css`): the org-wide
  34px strip across the very top with **View source**, required on every site on the domain.
  Built from the theme tokens, so all 16 themes pick it up.
- **Consent gate**: `index.html` loads the shared `https://ai-automation-tools.dev/consent.js`.
  Nothing here tracks anyone; the gate is there for the day something does.
- README, docs, SECURITY and the bug template point at the new host.

## 2026-10-12 — Two new prompts in thin folders

- **Zero-Based Budget Rebuild** (`4_Prompts/Finance/Budgets/zero-based-budget-rebuild.md`):
  rebuilds a budget from drivers instead of last year's number, classifies lines as
  committed, driven or discretionary, and ranks discretionary spend against a target.
- **Access Recertification Campaign Planner**
  (`4_Prompts/IT_Security/Governance/access-recertification-campaign.md`): plans a user-access
  review with risk tiers, reviewer packets, escalation defaults and audit evidence.

`api/prompt-index.json` rebuilt (3,202 prompts).

## 2026-10-10 — `x-twitter-scraper` resynced after another upstream rewrite

The newest drift comment on issue #339 (2026-10-05) listed two `behind` skills,
`x-twitter-scraper` and `timesfm-forecasting`. Both had already been resynced in #358 later
that same day, after the check ran. Re-running `resync-upstream.mjs` on them today:

- **`timesfm-forecasting`**: body and all 21 files identical to upstream @ `92ace75`. Only the
  `checked:` date would have moved, so nothing was committed.
- **`x-twitter-scraper`**: `xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper` rewrote it again after #358
  (`6790d40` → `588529e`). `SKILL.md` is now organised into Request contract / Capabilities /
  Inputs / Outputs / Prices and limits / Consent rules tables, and a new **AI analysis**
  route family (sentiment, brand, news, market signals, viral score, classify, at 2 credits
  per post) was added to `references/reads.md` and the pricing table. `extractions.md` and
  `writes.md` were restructured into tables. Same skill, same scope, so it stays in
  `Business/Marketing`. `name`, `description` and the rest of the local frontmatter are
  unchanged; only `upstream.ref` and `upstream.checked` moved.

Scanned the incoming files for email addresses and CRLF line endings: none. The index rebuild
changed one entry's `lastModified` and the `buildTime`, nothing else.

_Touched: `site/library/3_Skills/Business/Marketing/x-twitter-scraper/` (SKILL.md,

## 2026-10-09 — Upstream check

First pass over `UPSTREAMS.md`. Nothing the code depends on has been removed or deprecated.
`UPSTREAMS.md` described the wrong fonts (Outfit / DM Sans via CSS `@import`); the app loads
Inter and JetBrains Mono through `<link>` tags in `index.html`, and the row says so now.
Node 22 reaches end of life on 2027-04-30; moving to 24 is queued on the roadmap.

## 2026-10-05 — UI redesign

The React app was rebuilt onto the org design vocabulary that ai-automation-tools.dev and the
other sites share, so the library reads as a sibling of them. Routing, data fetching, the
hooks and the API are untouched; the change is `src/index.css`, `src/themes.css`,
`index.html` and every component.

- **Tokens.** `#060606` ground with a 24px dot grid, zinc surfaces, sky-400 accent, Inter for
  text and JetBrains Mono for eyebrows / tags / keys, 12/8/6px radii. Every colour is a custom
  property on `:root`; the 16 themes are `:root[data-theme]` overrides of those properties and
  nothing else (`themes.css` was regenerated onto the new names). The theme now persists in
  `localStorage` and is applied before first paint.
- **Per-section accent.** Each section has a hue (prompts rose, agents cyan, guides violet,
  system prompts amber, skills emerald, skill packs teal — the per-tool accents on the org
  landing page), exposed as `--c` from `data-section` on `<html>`. Cards, glyphs, tonal
  buttons and the hero title tint from it; themes other than the default and Light collapse it
  to their own accent so a monochrome theme stays monochrome.
- **Navigation.** The sidebar's `<select>` of sections is a proper nav list with icons, live
  counts and an animated active indicator; the category tree gained a filter box. The top bar
  carries breadcrumbs, a ⌘K search trigger, one Resources mega-menu (replacing five pill
  dropdowns), "New prompt" and an account menu. New **command palette** (⌘K / Ctrl+K)
  searches every loaded prompt, jumps between sections, creates a prompt and switches theme
  from the keyboard.
- **Cards.** Spotlight cards (cursor-tracked ring and wash in `--c`), a plain-text blurb
  instead of raw markdown, shimmer skeletons while previews load, and an action row that
  reveals on hover (always visible on touch). Stagger-in on mount.
- **Visuals.** An ambient constellation canvas tinted by the tokens sits behind the app
  (pauses when hidden, static under `prefers-reduced-motion`); the hero counters count up.
- **Everything else** restyled onto the tokens: hero, toolbar (sort is a menu, tags filterable),
  detail page (metadata rail, word count, grouped actions), Skill Packs (was on raw `gray-*`
  classes that ignored the theme), modals on one shared shell, toasts with a progress bar,
  empty states. My Library → Skill Packs while signed out shows the sign-in state instead
  of a 401.

## 2026-10-05 — Documentation refresh

A sweep of `docs/` and the root README for anything the last two months of changes had left
behind. No code.

- **Setup and deployment** still said `cd my-prompt-library && npm install` and "create
  `.env` in the project root". Both now say `site/`, and `DEPLOYMENT.md` names the Vercel
  Root Directory, production branch and what `vercel-build` does. A leftover `~/.openclaw/…`
  path in the deploy and debug guides is gone. Node prerequisite 18+ → 22 (what CI pins).
- **API reference** documents the login/signup rate limits, the input rules and the new 400 /
  429 responses, and its sample `id` / `section` values are the numbered folders
  (`2_Agents`, `4_Prompts`) instead of the pre-rename `library/Agents/…`, `Prompt_Library`,
  `Agent_Instructions`.
- **Templates, contributing guide, skill-pack guides, debug guide** — every `library/Skills/`,
  `library/Agents/`, `library/Prompt_Library/`, `library/Agent_Guides/` path and section
  example moved to the numbered layout.
- **Architecture** lists `middleware/rate-limit.ts`, and its security section no longer
  says "no authentication on API endpoints" with rate limiting as a future idea; it describes
  what is actually there (session-gated writes, `sameSite=lax` as the CSRF stand-in, limiters,
  `helmet`, `trust proxy`).
- **Library-mode design doc** carries a note that its Phase 2 filesystem `My_Prompts/` plan
  was superseded by Postgres.
- **docs/README** links the new root policy files (LICENSE, NOTICE, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT,
  CONTRIBUTING) and its status paragraph is current. **ROADMAP** snapshot's Security row and
  **UPSTREAMS** framework table include the two new auth dependencies. Root README structure
  and endpoint list match.

Left alone on purpose: `DIRECTION.md` (dated narrative), `FEATURED-PROMPTS.md` (content
tracking, last updated 2026-03-25), the audit reports, and `category:` frontmatter examples
such as `"Agent_Guides"`, which the `1_Guides` files really do still use.

## 2026-10-05 — Auth abuse controls, community files, branch prune, drift resync

Second pass of the same pre-publicity sweep.

**Auth.** `site/routes/auth.ts` accepted any string as an email and any 6+ characters as a
password, with no limit on how often a client could try. Now:

- `POST /api/auth/login` is limited to 20 attempts per IP per 15 minutes (successes don't
  count); `POST /api/auth/signup` to 5 per IP per 15 minutes. `express-rate-limit`, in-memory
  store, so on Vercel the count is per warm function instance. `app.set('trust proxy', 1)`
  makes `req.ip` the client behind Vercel's proxy instead of the proxy itself.
- Signup validates email shape (one `@`, no whitespace, ≤254 chars), requires 8–72 character
  passwords (72 because bcrypt silently ignores the rest), and caps `name` at 100. Login checks
  shape and the 72 cap only, so accounts created under the old 6-char rule still sign in. The
  signup modal's client-side minimum moved to 8 to match.
- `PUT /api/auth/me` rejects non-string or oversized `name` / `avatar_url`.
- `helmet` with CSP and HSTS off (Vite's inline preloads and Google Fonts would break under a
  default CSP; Vercel sets HSTS at the edge). JSON bodies capped at 1 MB.

Verified against the dev server: bad email and short password return 400 with the right
message; the 21st failed login in a window returns 429; `X-Powered-By` is gone and the
nosniff / frame / referrer headers are present.

**Community files.** Root `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, a short `CONTRIBUTING.md`
that points at the full guide in `docs/`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and
`bug_report` / `content_issue` issue templates with a config that routes security reports
to private advisories.

**Branches.** 19 merged remote branches deleted (see the roadmap entry for the exact list
and the three kept on purpose).

**Drift.** Today's drift run had 2 `behind` and 3 `drifted`. Resynced all five:
`x-twitter-scraper` (upstream dropped 63 reference files; we followed), `timesfm-forecasting`
(upstream deleted the generated `examples/*/output/` artifacts), `claude-api` (92 files from
Anthropic's current tree), `brainstorming` and `matlab`. **All 93 tracked skills are current
again.** The check needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` to run locally; anonymously it rate-limits at 60
requests and reports every skill as `error`.

`api/prompt-index.json` rebuilt. `npm run lint`, `test:routes`, `upstream.test.mjs` and
`skill-frontmatter.test.mjs` all pass.

**Still open:** the Neon password rotation and `DELETE FROM user_sessions;` need the Neon
console and are not something this pass could do.

## 2026-10-05 — Redact published contacts and sample credentials; add LICENSE

A pre-publicity pass over the library found two things a public repo should not carry.

- **Three teammates' email addresses, including personal gmail and yahoo accounts,** were
  listed as notification recipients in `2_Agents/Platform_Agents/Financial/market-agent.md`,
  `2_Agents/Platform_Agents/Ax-Platform_Dev/ax-platform-developer.md` and
  `3_Skills/Finance/Portfolio_Management/financial-analysis/SKILL.md`, and served on the live
  site. Replaced with `<recipient-N@your-org.example>` placeholders and a note not to commit
  real addresses.
- **Three Neon connection strings with embedded passwords** in the vendored `using-neon`
  skill's REST API reference (`branches.md`, `projects.md`). They are Neon's own doc samples,
  not live credentials, but they match every secret scanner's pattern and have been in history
  since the first import. Passwords replaced with `npg_REDACTED_EXAMPLE` in all six places.
  History was not rewritten.
- **`LICENSE` did not exist.** The README had claimed Apache 2.0 since the start, but without
  the file the code was all-rights-reserved by default. Added the Apache 2.0 text at the repo
  root, plus a `NOTICE` explaining that vendored skills under `site/library/` carry their own
  licenses (Apache-2.0 and MIT, each next to its `SKILL.md`) and that the Awesome ChatGPT prompts
  are CC0. The README license section now says the same.

`api/prompt-index.json` rebuilt: only the five touched entries' `lastModified` changed.

## 2026-10-04 — An upstream worklist for the app

`docs/UPSTREAMS.md` lists what the app assumes about Neon and `pg`, the GitHub REST API (GitHub
mode), Google Fonts, Vercel, Node and the framework majors, with the official page to check
each against. A biweekly **Prompt-Library Upstream Check** routine works from it and opens an
`upstream/auto-*` PR only when something outside the repo changed. The vendored library content
is out of its scope: `upstream-drift.yml` already covers that.

## 2026-10-03 — URL routing state moves out of `App.tsx`

The last big block of state in the shell was navigation: the section tab, category,
subcategory and `?prompt=` deep link, each seeded from the query string, re-read on
back/forward, and written back on every change. It now lives in `src/hooks/useLibraryRoute.ts`.
No behaviour change intended.

**What changed:**

- **`useLibraryRoute`** owns `activeTab`, `activeCategory`, `activeSubcategory` and
  `promptPathParam`, the `popstate` listener and the `replaceState` write-back. It takes
  `selectedPrompt` and the `setSelectedPrompt` / `setLibraryMode` setters, because back/forward
  can clear the open prompt and switch library.
- **One section parser.** `?section=` was decoded by two hand-written if-chains, the initial
  state and the popstate handler, and they had drifted before (`skill-packs` was missing from
  one, so a refresh on Skill Packs landed on Prompts). Both now call one `parseSection` over a
  single tab list, and the write-back sets `section` to the tab id directly instead of through a
  ternary that mapped every value to itself.
- **Stays in `App.tsx`:** `libraryMode` (own localStorage persistence), resolving a `?prompt=`
  path to a prompt (needs the loaded listing and `handlePromptClick`), and the explicit
  `pushState` in "show all".
- `App.tsx` 1,083 → **996 lines**, 23 → 19 `useState` hooks.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint`, `npm run test:routes` and `npm run build`, all clean. On the
dev server (no database): a `?prompt=` deep link to a skill opened it and filled in
`section=skills&category=AI_ML`; browser back and forward between it and a System Prompts URL
restored each view; an unknown `section` fell back to Prompts; `section=skill-packs` loaded on
Skill Packs.

## 2026-09-28 — Rebuilding the prompt index no longer rewrites it

`lastModified` in `api/prompt-index.json` is each file's mtime, and a checkout stamps every
file's mtime with the checkout time. So any `npm run build` or `npm run build:index` on a
fresh clone rewrote `lastModified` for all 3,200 prompts, plus `buildTime` — a whole-file diff
on a library nobody had touched, and every prompt claiming it changed today. The last three
content PRs each put the committed timestamps back by hand. The roadmap item offered two
fixes, and both were wrong for this: a pre-commit rebuild would *produce* that churn on every
commit, and not committing the index would take the CI freshness gate with it.

**What changed:**

- **`build-prompt-index.js` carries timestamps forward.** Before writing, it reads the
  previous index. An entry keeps its old `lastModified` when every other field is unchanged
  *and* its file has no uncommitted edits (`git diff HEAD`, run inside `library/`). The git
  check is what catches an edit below the 200-character preview, which changes no field of the
  entry. `buildTime` is kept too when the whole prompt list comes out identical. Rebuilding an
  untouched library now leaves the file byte-identical — on a fresh worktree, on CI, on Vercel.
  Without git the check falls back to the metadata comparison alone.
- **The CI gate compares the whole file.** It used to strip `buildTime` and `lastModified`
  with `jq` because they could not match on a fresh checkout. They can now, so the step is a
  plain `git diff --exit-code` after the rebuild.

**Behaviour change on the live site.** Vercel's `vercel-build` rebuilds the index from a clean
checkout, so production now serves the committed `lastModified` values instead of the deploy
time. Newest/Oldest sort, and the featured row's fallback in a section with no `featured` tags,
will order by when each entry was last rebuilt with a real change rather than by checkout order.
It is still an mtime, not a content fact — that is the *Surface freshness* item.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint`, `npm run test:routes` and `npm run build` (all clean), and
`git status` after the build showing the index untouched in a fresh worktree. A body-only edit
below the preview changes exactly that entry's `lastModified` and `buildTime`; a title edit
with git unavailable (`GIT_DIR` pointed nowhere) still changes that entry and nothing else.

## 2026-09-27 — `executing-plans` resynced after upstream rewrote it

The 2026-09-21 drift check (issue #339) listed one `behind` skill:
`3_Skills/Content/executing-plans`, 99% missing — 323 local words against 3,311 upstream.
It was `current` when resynced on 2026-09-08; `obra/superpowers` has since rewritten the skill
from a short load-review-execute checklist into a full inline-execution procedure (task loop,
completion contract, ledgered "rulings", one whole-branch review at the end).

**What landed:**

- **`SKILL.md` body** replaced with upstream @ `8ca22db`, and the `upstream:` block restamped.
  `name` and `description` are unchanged, and the skill still sits under `Content/` — it is
  the same skill, grown, not a different one.
- **`scripts/task-start` and `scripts/task-done`** are new, mirrored from upstream (LF, 80
  lines between them).

**One caveat, inherited from upstream.** `task-start` shells out to
`../../subagent-driven-development/scripts/task-brief`, a sibling superpowers skill this
library does not carry. The scripts are shipped as upstream wrote them and will not run
standalone; the old body already leaned on `superpowers:*` siblings the same way, so this is
the existing shape rather than a new break.

**The index without the churn.** A fresh worktree stamps every file's mtime at checkout, so
the rebuild rewrote `lastModified` for all 3,200 prompts. Every entry whose content was
otherwise identical got its committed `lastModified` back, leaving a three-line index diff:
`buildTime` and the one entry's `contentPreview` and `lastModified`. Newest/Oldest sort is
untouched for everything else.

**Verified with:** `npm run build:index` (3,200 prompts, no `[WARN] Failed to parse
frontmatter`), `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run test:routes` (8 routes present),
`npm run build` (clean). Against `npm run dev`: the public listing returns 3,200, the skill
is listed under `Content`, and `GET /api/prompts/:id` serves the new body.

## 2026-09-19 — The long-tail pass, and two starving categories it could feed

`docs/ROADMAP.md` asked for four long-tail topics — Data Science, Blockchain/Web3, Design,
industry verticals — and carried a note underneath saying `4_Prompts/Development` had one
file and `4_Prompts/Data` had two, making them the thinnest categories in the section by a
wide margin. Those two facts answer each other, so three of the four topics went into a
category that already existed and was empty rather than into a new one. 58 new prompts,
library **3,142 → 3,200**.

**What landed:**

- **Data Science — `4_Prompts/Data`, 2 → 20.** Four new subfolders. `Analysis` (EDA plan,
  analytical SQL reviewer, cohort retention, A/B test interpreter, metric definition writer),
  `Data_Engineering` (dbt model reviewer, data quality checks, pipeline postmortem, schema
  migration), `Machine_Learning` (feature engineering with the leakage question up front,
  model evaluation, model card, training data audit, baseline selection),
  `Visualization` (chart type selection, dashboard spec, executive narrative, accessible
  chart review).
- **Blockchain/Web3 — `4_Prompts/Development/Blockchain`, 12 new, category 1 → 13.** Contract
  security review, gas optimization, ERC-20 and ERC-721 specs, a Foundry test suite generator,
  upgradeable proxy review, wallet integration, subgraph schema, DAO proposal drafting,
  tokenomics review, bridge and oracle risk, on-chain forensics.
- **Design — `4_Prompts/Design`, new, 16.** `UX_Research` (interview guide, usability test
  plan, synthesis, jobs-to-be-done analysis), `UI_Design` (wireframe spec, critique
  facilitation, empty-state and error copy, responsive layout), `Design_Systems` (token
  naming, component API, contribution review, iconography), `Accessibility` (WCAG audit,
  screen reader flow, contrast remediation, form review).
- **Industry verticals — `Domain_Specific`, 12 new, 63 → 75.** `Real_Estate` (listing copy
  with fair-housing constraints, CMA, lease abstract, investment underwriting, tenant notices,
  acquisition diligence) and `Manufacturing` (8D root cause, SOP writing, supplier audit,
  preventive maintenance, SMED changeover, incident and near-miss reporting), 6 each.

**Two placement calls worth recording.**

**Blockchain went under `Development`, not `Engineering`.** `Engineering` is the crowded
general software category — 88 files, and it already carries the same `ethereum-developer`
role-play under three different paths. Filing twelve specialist web3 prompts there would have
deepened a duplication problem the roadmap tracks separately, and would have left
`Development` sitting at the one file the item complained about. `Development` had no
identity to protect; it has one now.

**`Design` is the one new top-level category, and it was not avoidable.** The previous content
pass made a point of adding nothing top-level, and that was right then, because every topic had
an existing home. This one does not: `Media/` is imagery and social, `Engineering/` holds two
stray design files (`website-design-consultant`, `ux_ui_developer`), and nothing in
`4_Prompts` covered product design. `3_Skills` already has a `Design` category, so the name
is the library's own vocabulary rather than an invention.

**House style, not the bulk-file template.** Every file names its inputs, states what the model
must *not* infer, and ends with an output format, `Related Prompts` and `Reputable Sources` —
the `Domain_Specific/Legal` shape, not the "provide a step-by-step implementation plan"
filler the older `Business/` files share. Disclaimers are on the files where getting it wrong
has a legal, financial or physical consequence: the Blockchain prompts that touch value at
risk, all six Real_Estate files, and the Manufacturing safety ones. Several prompts carry a
refusal built in — the listing writer enumerates the fair-housing phrasings it will not
produce and says why; the incident report forbids "operator error" as a finding and
"retrain the operator" as a sole corrective action.

**No `featured` tags,** for the same reason as last time: the featured row filters section-wide
and sorts on `lastModified`, so 58 new files would have taken it over.

**Left alone deliberately:** `4_Prompts/Development/Api_Design/python-debugger.md`, a
four-line stub that is now one file in a thirteen-file category. Rewriting it is a different
job from filling a category, and it is not what the roadmap item asked for.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run test:routes` (8 routes present),
`npm run build` (clean; the one esbuild CSS warning is pre-existing and unrelated, and chunk
sizes are unchanged). `npm run build:index` reported 3,200 prompts with **no
`[WARN] Failed to parse frontmatter`** — a malformed block silently drops a file from the
library, so that warning line is the real test for content work. All 58 files are LF and
lowercase-pathed, and a link check confirmed all 58 `Related Prompts` cross-links resolve to
files that exist. Against `npm run dev` on the read-only public library: the listing returns
3,200 with all 58 new files present at the right `category`/`subcategory`, and with `content`
still empty for every one of them — the 2026-09-08 guarantee holds for the new files too;
`POST /api/prompts/previews` returned real blurbs for a Blockchain and a Manufacturing file;
and `GET /api/prompts/:id` returned the full 2,600-byte body for a new Design file.

**Not verified:** how the new `Design` top-level category renders in the sidebar and category
tree. That list is built client-side from the index, which is correct and was checked in the
API response, but nothing here exercised the UI — that needs a browser or a Vercel preview.

**The index diff is large and mostly noise,** as on the last content pass. `lastModified` comes
from filesystem mtime and this was built in a fresh worktree, so rebuilding restamped all 3,142
pre-existing entries; roughly 3,140 of the changed lines are that churn and the real change is
the 58 new entries. CI strips `lastModified` before comparing, so the freshness gate is
unaffected.

## 2026-09-16 — The drift report was ranking rewrites as perfect matches

The roadmap said the `behind` tier had been empty since 2026-08-27 and the worst remaining drift
was 21%. Both numbers came from the same broken measurement.

`check-upstream-drift.mjs` reported a `missing` column computed as
`max(0, 1 - local_words / upstream_words)`. That clamp is the bug. It only measures *shortfall*,
so it reads 0% for any skill where the local copy is the larger file — and "the local copy is
larger" is exactly what an upstream rewrite into tighter prose looks like. The files that had
rotted furthest sorted to the bottom of the table looking perfect.
`Finance/Investing/trading-operations/skills/counterparty-risk` sat at **0% missing** with a
local body four times upstream's length and not a single section in common: upstream had
reorganized it into three named workflows (assessing a counterparty, responding to credit
deterioration, executing a close-out) while the local copy still carried the old flat
`Purpose`/`Layer`/`Direction` prose. `Content/xlsx` was worse than drifted — it had two `# ` H1s,
two concatenated documents in one file, and the report called it a 0% match.

**The fix, then the backlog.** The checker now compares normalized non-empty lines in both
directions and reports two numbers instead of one: `missing` (upstream lines this copy does not
have — a resync candidate) and `extra` (local lines upstream does not have — curation a resync
would destroy). The `behind` verdict comes from `missing >= 25%`, not from a size ratio. On the
corrected ranking:

| | before the fix | after the fix |
|:---|---:|---:|
| `behind` | 0 | **9** (28–96% missing) |
| `drifted` | 46 | 37 |
| `current` | 47 | 47 |

**Then all 46 were resynced, in three passes.** The nine `behind` first. Then the 26
`joellewis/finance_skills` skills, which turned out to be one upstream pass applied uniformly —
the `Purpose`/`Layer`/`Direction`/`When to Use` preamble dropped (that information now lives in
`description:`) in favour of `Worked Examples`, `Common Pitfalls` and `Cross-References` — so
they were brought to a single sha (`5c498ea`) rather than decided one at a time. Then the last
11 individually. **All 93 tracked skills are now byte-identical to their upstreams**; `behind`
and `drifted` are both empty for the first time on a measurement that can actually see a
rewrite.

**Three calls worth recording, because each one nearly went the other way:**

- **`frontend-design` was resynced with `--keep-extra`.** A plain resync would have pruned its
  `LICENSE.txt`, which upstream does not ship. Deleting a license file from a vendored copy is
  not a freshness decision.
- **`timesfm-forecasting` looked like it would lose 2,000 words** — upstream had collapsed four
  sections (output/config, workflows, performance tuning, examples and validation) into a
  four-line list. It had moved them into `references/`, which the resync mirrors, so nothing was
  lost. Worth checking rather than assuming; the reverse case is real.
- **`docx` and `xlsx` reported 55 and 5 stale files.** Upstream had moved `ooxml/schemas/` to
  `scripts/office/schemas/` and `scripts/validation/` to `scripts/office/validators/`. A move,
  not a deletion. `xlsx`'s `recalc.py` moved to `scripts/recalc.py`, which is where its new
  SKILL.md points.

**Two things fell out of it.**

`Data/timesfm-forecasting` had four **Git LFS pointer files** vendored as content — 131-byte
text stubs reading `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1` where a PNG and a GIF should be.
The resync fetched the real bytes (verified against the `size` the pointers themselves declared),
so the skill's example images work now. A sweep confirms zero LFS pointers remain anywhere under
`library/`.

`npm run lint` broke, because the resync pulled a vendored `.ts` sample
(`together-gpu-clusters/scripts/manage_cluster.ts`) into the app's typecheck, which failed on a
`together-ai` import the app does not depend on. `tsconfig.json` already carried two hand-added
per-skill excludes for exactly this, which is the wrong shape — every new vendored `.ts` breaks
CI until someone appends a line. Replaced with `library/**/*`. Nothing in `src/`, `api/`,
`server.ts`, `routes/`, `middleware/` or `db/` imports from `library/`; it is read as data at
runtime, so the app's typechecker has no business in it.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run test:routes` (8 routes),
`scripts/upstream.test.mjs` (322 stamped files, vocabulary intact),
`scripts/skill-frontmatter.test.mjs` (323 files parse, names match directories), `npm run build`
(clean, chunk sizes unchanged). `npm run build:index` rebuilt at the same **3,142** prompts with
no `[WARN] Failed to parse frontmatter`. A link check across all 46 touched skills resolved every
relative path in their `SKILL.md` — 0 unresolved. Every rewritten text file is LF; the four
binaries are byte-identical to upstream and `.gitattributes` marks them `binary`, not `eol=lf`.
Against `npm run dev`: the listing returns 3,142; `GET /api/prompts/:id` returns the *new* bodies
(`xlsx` 7,556 chars opening on "Requirements for every output", `counterparty-risk` 16,316 on
`Core Concepts`/`Worked Examples`/`Cross-References`); `POST /api/prompts/previews` returns
non-empty blurbs for them; and `GET /api/skills/download/:path` still produces valid zips for the
reorganized trees (`docx` 72 entries, `xlsx` 63 including `scripts/recalc.py`,
`timesfm-forecasting` 40).

**Left open:** `description:` is still local-only. `resync-upstream.mjs` preserves the whole
frontmatter block, which is right for `title`/`tags`/`category` and wrong for `description` —
upstream maintains that field too, and it is what a skill triggers on. All 93 bodies are level
while some descriptions are a year stale. Filed on the roadmap under *Content provenance*.

## 2026-09-12 — Filled the five thin categories, starting with the one that had nothing

`docs/ROADMAP.md` listed five thin categories. Counting them first changed the shape of the
job: **Healthcare had zero files in `4_Prompts`**, Education had five, and Legal/Compliance
had twenty-two and was not actually thin — it was buried two levels deep under
`Domain_Specific/`, which is a different problem. 54 new prompts, library **3,088 → 3,142**.

**What landed:**

- **Healthcare — new, 0 → 16.** `4_Prompts/Domain_Specific/Healthcare/` across four
  subcategories: `Clinical_Documentation` (SOAP note, discharge summary, referral letter,
  SBAR handoff), `Patient_Communication` (plain-language explainer, medication sheet,
  pre-procedure prep, reminder sequence), `Operations` (prior authorization, denial appeal,
  coding review, schedule optimizer), `Compliance` (Security Rule risk assessment, Safe Harbor
  de-identification, BAA review, breach notification plan).
- **Education — 5 → 17.** `K12` gains a rubric builder, conference prep, IEP goal writer and
  behavior support plan; `Higher_Ed` a Socratic tutor, outcomes mapper and feedback writer;
  `Curriculum` backward design, standards alignment, reading-level adaptation, formative
  assessment and multiple-choice item writing.
- **Legal/Compliance — 22 → 30.** `Regulatory` was the thin part at two files: EU AI Act
  readiness, SOX control narrative, AML/KYC review, records retention. Plus two contract
  reviewers and a new `Employment` subfolder.
- **E-commerce — 12 → 22** and **Personal Productivity — 13 → 21**.

**Placement was deliberately boring.** Everything went into folders that already exist.
Healthcare sits under `Domain_Specific/` because that is where Education and Legal already
live, so it needed no new top-level category and no restructuring. The open roadmap question
about what `2_Agents` is stays open and untouched. `2_Agents/Domain_Specific/Healthcare/`
already held five agent *definitions*; these are prompts, in the prompt section, and the two
do not collide.

**Written in the `Domain_Specific/Legal` house style**, not the other one. The older bulk
`Business/` files follow a template that says "Provide: step-by-step implementation plan,
templates and examples, tools and integrations needed" regardless of topic — that is a prompt
about being helpful, not a prompt about e-commerce. Every new file names its inputs, states
what the model must *not* infer, and ends with an output format. Healthcare and Legal files
carry a disclaimer, and every Healthcare file says not to paste PHI into a service without a
Business Associate Agreement.

**No `featured` tags.** The featured row filters section-wide on the `featured` tag and sorts
by `lastModified`; 54 new files would have taken it over.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run test:routes` (8 routes), `npm run build`
(clean; chunk sizes unchanged). `npm run build:index` reported 3,142 prompts with **no
`[WARN] Failed to parse frontmatter`** — a malformed frontmatter block silently drops a file
from the library, so that warning line is the real test for content work. Against `npm run
dev`: the listing returns all 3,142 with 16 Healthcare prompts under `4_Prompts` and 5 under
`2_Agents`, `Business/Ecommerce` at 22 and `Business/Productivity` at 21; a 26-id
`POST /api/prompts/previews` batch covering the new files returned 26 non-empty blurbs; and
`GET /api/prompts/:id` returned a full 2,510-character body for a new Healthcare file. All 54
files are LF.

**The index diff is large and mostly noise.** `lastModified` comes from filesystem mtime and
this work was done in a fresh worktree, so rebuilding restamped all 3,088 pre-existing entries.
Roughly 3,090 of the changed lines are that churn; the real change is the 54 new entries. CI
strips `lastModified` before comparing, so the freshness gate is unaffected.

## 2026-09-08 — Stopped shipping 3,088 card blurbs to render 50

The listing response had quietly become the largest thing on first load — **338 KB gzipped**,
against 200 KB for the entire JS bundle. 632 KB of its 2.2 MB raw was `contentPreview`: a
200-character excerpt of every prompt in the library. Nothing that operates on the whole
listing reads it. Search matches title, tags, category and subcategory (`usePromptFilters`
never had `content` among its Fuse keys); sort uses title and `lastModified`; the category
tree and tag facets are built from metadata. The only consumer is the blurb under a card
title — and at most ~50 cards are on screen.

**What changed:**

- `GET /api/prompts?lightweight=true` no longer carries body text for the public library,
  in any of its three source paths (prebuilt index, local filesystem walk, GitHub mode).
  The response went **338 KB → 117.6 KB gzipped**, with all 3,088 prompts and every metadata
  field intact.
- New `POST /api/prompts/previews` takes `{ ids: string[] }` and returns `{ [id]: preview }`,
  served out of a Map built once from the prebuilt index, falling back to reading the file for
  ids the index does not have. POST rather than GET because 50 library paths do not fit in a
  query string. Ids are capped at 200 per request, restricted to `.md`, and resolved through
  the existing `resolveInside` traversal guard; unresolvable ids are omitted rather than
  failing the batch.
- New `src/hooks/usePromptPreviews.ts` fills blurbs in for whatever is on screen. It is called
  once inside `PromptCardGrid` — the component all three lists (featured, paginated,
  subcategory) render through — so no preview map is drilled through `PromptCardActions`. Its
  cache and in-flight map are module-level, because those three grids mount together and would
  otherwise request the same ids two and three times over. A page costs ~4 KB gzipped, paging
  back to a visited page costs nothing.
- **My Library keeps its inline previews.** It is one user's own prompts rather than 3,088, and
  the previews endpoint only knows about library files.

**Three bugs fixed on the way, all the same root cause** — callers treating the listing's
truncated `content` as the real body:

- **Card → Copy** put the 200-character preview on the clipboard, not the prompt.
- **Card → Download** wrote that same preview into the `.md` file.
- **Card → Edit** seeded the editor with it, so saving a My Library prompt from a card
  **truncated it to 200 characters**. That one was silent data loss.

All three now resolve the body through one `fetchFullContent` helper hitting
`GET /api/prompts/:id`. `PromptDetail` was never affected — `handlePromptClick` already
fetched. The card copy path hands `navigator.clipboard.write` a `ClipboardItem` wrapping the
pending fetch, because Safari drops the user-gesture clipboard permission across an `await`.

The search placeholder no longer claims to search "content" — it never did, and now there is
no content in the listing to search.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run test:routes` (8 routes, up from 7),
`npm run build` (clean; entry chunk 181 → 184 KB). Against `npm run dev`: the listing returns
3,088 prompts across all five sections at 117.6 KB gzipped with zero non-empty `content`
fields; a 50-id preview batch returns all 50 at 4.2 KB gzipped. Nine traversal payloads
(`../../.env`, `..\..\.env.md`, `/etc/passwd.md`, `3_Skills/../../.env.md`, …) all return `{}`;
a non-array body returns 400; a 400-id request returns 200. In Playwright: all 54 first-paint
cards render blurbs from two batched requests, paging forward fetches one more and paging back
fetches none, search still filters, the subcategory list of 1,349 cards fills from seven
chunked batches, and clicking Copy issues a `GET /api/prompts/<id>` for the full body and
reports success.

The new card-action logic went into `src/hooks/usePromptContent.ts` rather than into
`App.tsx`, which ends the day at **1,083 lines and 24 `useState` hooks** — one line and one
hook below where it started.

## 2026-09-07 — Shrank the `motion` bundle with LazyMotion

`motion` was the only sizeable dependency still loading before first paint — a 128 KB chunk
pulled in by the full `motion.div` component, which unconditionally bundles drag, layout
projection, and gesture-tracking code whether or not a component uses it. This app doesn't:
a repo-wide check turned up no `drag`, `layout`/`layoutId`, or motion-value hooks (`useMotionValue`,
`useTransform`, `useScroll`, `useSpring`) anywhere — every usage is a plain enter/exit animation
or `whileTap`.

**What changed:**

- All 10 files importing `motion` from `motion/react` (`App.tsx` and 9 components) now import
  `m` instead, and `App.tsx` wraps its returned tree in a single
  `<LazyMotion features={domAnimation} strict>`. `strict` mode throws at runtime if any
  `motion.*` usage is missed, rather than silently double-shipping the animation engine.
- The `motion` output chunk dropped from **128 KB to 81.82 KB** (gzip 29.18 KB) — tree-shaking
  the drag/layout/gesture code the full `motion` component always carries.
- It did **not** become an async, deferred chunk. `motion-dom` ships as a single flat ES module
  with no internal split between its core and `domAnimation`'s feature set, so there's nothing
  for a dynamic `import()` to carve off — `m`, `AnimatePresence`, and `domAnimation` all live in
  the same file and load together. The win here is bytes shipped, not load timing.

**Verified with:** `npm run lint` (clean), `npm run build` (chunk sizes above, no errors), and a
Playwright smoke pass against `npm run dev` — loaded the homepage, opened a prompt card
(`PromptDetail`, lazy-loaded) and the Login modal (`LoginModal`, lazy-loaded, also behind
`AnimatePresence`) and confirmed no new console errors beyond the pre-existing `401` on
`/api/auth/me` (expected with no `DATABASE_URL` configured).

## 2026-09-05 — Rewrote the OpenAI CLI guide against current docs

`1_Guides/API_Providers/openai_cli_guide.md` was the one file the GPT-4o model-ID
sweep had deliberately skipped, because a find-and-replace on a guide built around
GPT-4o pricing, rate limits, and CLI syntax would have produced confident wrong
numbers rather than fixing anything.

**What changed, checked against OpenAI's own docs rather than guessed:**

- **The CLI itself was wrong, not just the model names.** The old guide invented
  `pip install openai-cli` and an `openai api chat.completions.create -m ...` syntax
  that doesn't match any current or past official tool. The real `openai` CLI installs
  via Homebrew or `go install`, and is built around the Responses API
  (`openai responses create`, `openai images generate`, `openai audio:speech create`).
  Codex CLI (the agentic coding tool, `codex`) is a separate binary and is now called
  out as such, instead of being blended into the same "CLI" section.
- **Responses API replaces Chat Completions as the primary SDK example.** OpenAI's own
  guidance is that new integrations build on Responses; Chat Completions remains
  supported, so its examples stayed in as a labeled legacy-compatible section rather
  than being deleted.
- **Models and pricing now name the current lineup** — GPT-6 Astra, GPT-5.6
  Sol/Terra/Luna, o3/o3-mini — sourced from `developers.openai.com/api/docs/pricing`
  and `/models`, with a note that these numbers move and to check the live page
  before quoting one.
- **The fixed "Tier 3" rate-limit table is gone.** Rate limits are per-organization
  and change independently of this doc, so it now points at the account's own limits
  page and the `x-ratelimit-*` response headers instead of a table that was already
  guesswork in the original.

_Touched: `site/library/1_Guides/API_Providers/openai_cli_guide.md`,
`site/api/prompt-index.json` (rebuild — only this file's title/tags/contentPreview
changed; the rest of the diff is `lastModified`/`buildTime` mtime churn from a fresh
worktree checkout), `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-08-29 — One word meaning two things in the provenance data

Seven skills — `docx`, `xlsx`, `executing-plans`, `accessibility-compliance`,
`algorithmic-art`, `supabase-postgres-best-practices` and `canvas-design` — carried
`upstream.match: behind` in their frontmatter. Read straight, that says the library is
running behind upstream on seven skills. It doesn't. `behind` was being spelled by two
scripts with two unrelated meanings:

- **`attribute-upstream.mjs`** stamps `match:` as *attribution confidence* — how sure we are
  about where a file came from. Its `behind` meant "this is the same skill as that upstream
  file, matched by 8-word shingle overlap or by an exact directory-name hit on a first-party
  publisher, but the bodies are not byte-identical."
- **`check-upstream-drift.mjs`** assigns `behind` as a *freshness verdict* at run time —
  "the local copy is missing more than 25% of upstream's content." That tier has been empty
  since 2026-08-27.

The roadmap offered two ways out: re-run the attributor, or rename the value. Re-running it
needs the ~110k-skill mirror clone and would have restamped the same seven files with the
same colliding word, so the rename is the actual fix.

**The attribution label is now `similar`.** Same semantics, same three code paths, no
behaviour change: `check-upstream-drift.mjs` skips `unknown`, `ambiguous` and `fork` and
checks everything else, so all seven are still tracked. The target count before and after is
**93**, unchanged.

**A guard, so it cannot come back.** `scripts/upstream.test.mjs` now walks all 323 skills and
asserts every `upstream.match` value is one of `exact` / `prefix` / `similar` / `ambiguous` /
`unknown` / `fork` — 322 are stamped, one is not. Reintroducing `match: behind` fails the
assertion (verified by putting it back and watching it fail). Both root-level self-checks —
`upstream.test.mjs` and `skill-frontmatter.test.mjs` — now run in CI as a *Provenance
self-checks* step; they had existed but nothing executed them, because the workflow's
`working-directory` is `site/` and they live at the repo root.

Both script headers now state the rule outright: `match:` is confidence, never freshness, and
the drift checker's verdict words do not belong in frontmatter.

The prompt index is untouched — `upstream:` frontmatter is not part of `contentPreview`, and a
rebuild confirmed the index is byte-identical apart from `buildTime`/`lastModified`.

_Touched: `scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs`, `scripts/check-upstream-drift.mjs`,
`scripts/upstream.test.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, seven `site/library/3_Skills/**/SKILL.md`,

## 2026-08-27 — Docs caught up with the day

Five changes landed today that made parts of the documentation wrong rather than merely
incomplete, so this is a sweep rather than an addition.

**`README.md`** — the API list was missing `GET /api/prompts/:id` (which exists, and is how
every prompt detail loads), the `lightweight` query parameter, and the skill-download route.
The project tree gained `.github/workflows/`, `.gitattributes` and `site/scripts/`. A short
*Checks* section now names `lint`, `test:routes` and `build:index`, and says CI runs them.

**`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the architecture diagram still drew the API layer as "Express +
Vercel Functions", two things side by side, which stopped being true when the implementations
were collapsed onto one app. Its storage box still showed the pre-rename `prompts/My_Prompts/
Collections` tree. Both redrawn; `routes/` is described as auth-only now that the skill-packs
router is gone.

**`CLAUDE.md`** — `server.ts` is described as what it now is (a 71-line wrapper around the
app `api/index.ts` exports) rather than "local Express dev server", which read as a second
implementation. Three conventions were added, each one a bug this repo actually shipped:

- LF only, because `contentPreview` is embedded in the index verbatim and CRLF makes it
  unreproducible on Linux;
- case-unique paths under `library/`, because two files differing only in case are one file on
  Windows and two on Linux;
- check what a bulk import is about to publish, because an upstream corpus put 350 contributor
  email addresses one commit away from a public site.

**`docs/skill-packs/README.md`** — pointed at `routes/skill-packs.ts`, deleted this morning.

**`docs/ROADMAP.md`** — snapshot rows for CI and line endings; `2_Agents`'s unusable-subagent
count refreshed 457/547 → 460/546; and the merged-branch list corrected from six to thirteen,
with `mike_desktop` and `main-backup-5_15_26` called out as decisions rather than deletes.

## 2026-08-27 — 1,349 prompts that shipped on every deploy and nobody could open

`2_Agents/Development/Other/` held two files over the index builder's 500 KB ceiling:
`act-as-an-expert.md` (3.4 MB) and `promptsdotchat-opensource.md` (2.5 MB). Being skipped by
the builder, neither was searchable, linkable, or openable — they were 5.8 MB of dead weight in
every deploy.

They are not what the filenames suggest. Both are the
[f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) corpus in `<details>`
form, and they are not duplicates of the 202-prompt `awesome-chatgpt.md` sitting next to them —
they carry **1,377** and **1,169** distinct prompts. Only 27 of those exist anywhere else in
the library.

`promptsdotchat-opensource.md` turned out to be **1,168 of its 1,169 prompts already inside**
`act-as-an-expert.md` — 2.5 MB of near-pure redundancy. The union is 1,378. Twenty titles
appear in both with different bodies; in each case the longer one is the later revision, so
that is the one kept.

### What shipped

1,378 minus 27 already-reachable minus 2 empty stubs = **1,349 files** under
`4_Prompts/Awesome_ChatGPT/General/`, each with the frontmatter the rest of `4_Prompts` uses
and tags derived from its title. Fifteen slug collisions were suffixed, and the slugs are all
lowercase — two files differing only in case are one file on Windows and two on Linux, which is
exactly how the index desynced last time.

| | before | after |
|:---|---:|---:|
| `2_Agents` | 7.7 MB / 548 files | **2.1 MB** / 546 files |
| `4_Prompts` | 1.3 MB / 561 files | 4.0 MB / 1,910 files |
| `site/library` | 30.3 MB / 2,864 files | **27.3 MB** / 4,211 files |
| prompt index | 1,739 prompts, 1.05 MB | **3,088** prompts, 1.91 MB |

### 350 email addresses that were about to be published

The upstream corpus credits contributors as `Contributed by [@handle](url)` — except **350 of
its 648 handles are email addresses**, not GitHub usernames. Splitting naively would have put
`[@someone@gmail.com](https://github.com/someone@gmail.com)` on a public site: a broken link,
and someone's personal address republished at `prompts.mikesailab.com`.

Attribution is emitted by handle only when the handle actually matches GitHub's username
grammar — **712 files** carry a named credit; the rest credit the repository and no individual.
Prompt bodies were scanned too: one email, `john.doe@defensetech.com`, plainly fictional. No
key-shaped strings anywhere in the 1,349.

### The cost, stated plainly

The lightweight listing every visit fetches went **159 KB → 311 KB gzipped**. That is
proportional to 78% more prompts rather than a regression in kind, but it now outweighs all the
JS on the page (200 KB gzipped), which makes pagination the next payload item rather than the
bundle. Filed on the roadmap.

Verified against a running server: 1,349 prompts in the listing under `Awesome_ChatGPT`, the
sidebar shows the category with its count, individual prompts resolve by id and render, and the
console is clean.

## 2026-08-27 — The CI gate could never have passed, and two reasons why

The index gate shipped that morning failed on its first real PR, and the failure was honest:
the committed `api/prompt-index.json` genuinely could not be reproduced by CI. Two independent
causes, neither of them the gate's fault.

### 1. Line endings — `.gitattributes`

2,131 of 2,132 content files were CRLF, and the repo had no `.gitattributes`. The index embeds
a 200-character `contentPreview` verbatim, so the copy built on Windows carried `
` and the
copy CI rebuilt from a Linux checkout carried `
`. Every PR would have failed on the same
diff no matter what it changed — the fastest way to teach a team to ignore a gate.

`eol=lf` rather than a bare `text=auto` is the part that matters: it normalizes the *working
tree* on Windows too, so the index is byte-reproducible on either platform. 647 files
renormalized; each staged change was checked to be line-endings-only by comparing blobs with
`
` stripped from both sides.

Four files had to be pulled back out of the sweep. The PNG/GIF "images" under
`timesfm-forecasting` are Git LFS **pointer files**, and the LFS spec requires LF. Marking
`*.png binary` correctly stopped git normalizing them — which meant `--renormalize` would have
staged the CRLF working-tree bytes and quietly broken the pointers. Restored byte-for-byte.

### 2. The same file tracked twice, under two spellings of one directory

`document-writer/SKILL.md` was tracked at **both** `3_Skills/Content/General/` and
`3_Skills/Content/general/` — same blob, two paths differing only in one capital letter. It has
been that way since the `site/` restructure.

On Windows those are one directory, so the checkout produces a single file and the local index
has 1,739 prompts. On a case-sensitive Linux runner they are two files, so CI built **1,740**
and failed against the committed 1,739. Nothing a Windows-only workflow could ever see.

This is also what made the file look untracked. `git ls-files --error-unmatch` on the
capital-G path said "did not match any file(s) known to git", `git status` never listed it, and
`git add -f` exited 0 while staging nothing — from bash *and* PowerShell, with the file neither
ignored, sparse-excluded, nor skip-worktree. Git was matching the working-tree file against the
lowercase-g index entry and correctly concluding there was nothing to do. It went in via
`hash-object` + `update-index`, and the lowercase duplicate was then dropped with
`update-index --force-remove` — the capital-G spelling matches its `humanizer` sibling and the
committed index.

It was the only case collision in `site/library/`; `3_Skills/packs/` is lowercase on purpose.

### 3. The index was ordered by whatever the filesystem returned

With the count finally matching, the gate still failed — on ordering. `fs.readdirSync` returns
the filesystem's own order: case-insensitive alphabetical on NTFS, hash order on ext4. Same
1,739 prompts, different array order, so the diff was every entry moving.

`build-prompt-index.js` now sorts by `id`. Verified as a pure reordering: the set of prompt
objects before and after is identical, 0 added and 0 removed. The app sorts client-side
(default title-asc), so this order was never what anyone saw — it just made the committed file
un-reproducible.

### Result

`npm run build:index` twice in a row now produces a byte-identical index, and the gate's own
comparison passes locally. Prompt count is unchanged at **1,739**; `lastModified` was carried
over per id, so the diff is the previews rather than 1,739 fresh checkout timestamps.

## 2026-08-27 — One 976 KB chunk became eight

First paint was a single `index-*.js` of **976 KB / 265 KB gzipped**, and Vite warned about it
on every build. It is now **706 KB / 200 KB gzipped** across three files, and nothing trips the
500 KB threshold.

| chunk | size | gzip | when it loads |
|:---|---:|---:|:---|
| `react-vendor` | 396.7 KB | 118.8 KB | first paint |
| `index` (app) | 180.9 KB | 39.0 KB | first paint |
| `motion` | 128.3 KB | 42.7 KB | first paint |
| markdown (shared) | 184.0 KB | 54.6 KB | opening a prompt or the editor |
| `SkillPacksView` | 28.5 KB | 3.9 KB | opening Skill Packs |
| `PromptEditorModal` | 17.6 KB | 2.9 KB | opening the editor |
| `PromptDetail` | 15.9 KB | 2.6 KB | opening a prompt |
| `SignupModal` / `LoginModal` | 14.8 / 9.3 KB | 2.5 / 1.8 KB | opening that modal |

Two changes did it.

**`React.lazy` on the five components that are never on screen at first paint** —
`SkillPacksView`, `PromptDetail`, `PromptEditorModal`, `LoginModal`, `SignupModal`. The prize
is not the components (each is 9–28 KB) but what two of them drag in: `react-markdown` +
`remark-gfm` pull the whole unified/micromark stack, 184 KB that used to be in the entry chunk
and is now a shared chunk fetched the first time you open a prompt.

The three modals needed one extra step. They were always mounted and self-hid with
`if (!isOpen) return null`, which would have fetched their chunks on page load and defeated the
split, so App now mounts them only while open. Behaviour is identical — each already rendered
nothing when closed, and the editor's form-init effect keys on the same flag.

**`manualChunks` for React and motion.** They are ~475 KB of the entry and change only when we
bump them, so they now live in their own chunks: editing a prompt no longer invalidates 400 KB
of React in every visitor's cache.

### What is left

`motion` is the only sizeable thing still on the critical path at 128 KB. `LazyMotion` with the
`m` components would cut most of it, but `motion/react` is imported in 10 files — a refactor,
filed on the roadmap rather than smuggled in here. React itself is not going anywhere.

### Two bugs the browser test found

Verifying the split in a real browser (built bundle, `NODE_ENV=production`) turned up a
pre-existing routing bug in two halves, both the same omission — `skill-packs` was never added
to the tab↔URL mapping:

- the `activeTab` initialiser had no `skill-packs` case, so a **deep link or refresh on
  `?section=skill-packs` silently landed on Prompts**. In-app navigation worked, because the
  `popstate` handler *does* have the case, which is why nobody noticed.
- the URL-sync effect had no `skill-packs` case either, so its ternary chain fell through to
  `'system-prompts'` — opening Skill Packs rewrote the address bar to a section you were not
  looking at, and copying that URL sent someone else somewhere else.

Both fixed. Confirmed against the built bundle: first paint fetches exactly three JS chunks,
each lazy chunk arrives only on the interaction that needs it, markdown renders, and the
console is clean.

---

## 2026-08-27 — `library/Legacy/` deleted, 14 system prompts rescued from it

2,393 files and 37 MB — half the library payload — shipped on every deploy while being
excluded from the index by all three readers. Gone.

The delete was not taken on faith. Every Legacy file was hashed against the live tree first:

| | files | |
|:---|---:|:---|
| byte-identical to a live file | 1,956 | pure duplicates |
| older revision of a file that survived under the same name | 404 | superseded |
| no counterpart at all | 33 | needed a decision |

Of the 33, sixteen were support files their upstreams have since deleted — `pptx`'s
`html2pptx.js`, `inventory.py`, `rearrange.py` and `replace.py`, `skill-creator`'s
`init_skill.py` and `output-patterns.md`, and the per-language `claude-api` stubs. The
resyncs pruned those on purpose; Legacy was holding the corpses.

The other seventeen were archived system prompts, and three of those turned out to be the
same prompt under a different filename (`chatgpt-4o.md`, `codeium-windsurf-cascade.md`,
`mistral-le-chat-pro.md` — 0.94–0.98 similarity to a live file after stripping frontmatter).
**The remaining fourteen were real, unreachable content and were promoted into
`5_System_Prompts/` instead of deleted:** Brave Leo, Cursor IDE Sonnet, DuckDuckGo's
GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 1.5, Meta AI on WhatsApp, four OpenAI prompts (Assistants API, ChatGPT-4o,
ChatGPT-5, Deep Research), Opera Aria, Roblox Studio Assistant, Snap My AI, Wrtn and xAI Grok.
Four vendor folders are new: `Opera/`, `Roblox/`, `Snapchat/`, `Wrtn/`.

That is why the index grew rather than shrank — **1,725 → 1,739 prompts** — and it confirms
the delete removed nothing the app could reach. `site/library/` is 75 MB → **38 MB**.

The `Legacy` guards in `build-prompt-index.js` and `api/index.ts` were left in place. They
are three lines, and they mean a `git checkout <sha> -- site/library/Legacy` to consult the
old tree does not silently double the index.

---

## 2026-08-27 — One API, not two

`server.ts` was a 555-line hand-maintained twin of `api/index.ts` (749 lines), and
`routes/skill-packs.ts` (335) a twin of `api/skill-packs.ts` (394). Both copies are gone.
`api/index.ts` now exports its Express app; `server.ts` is 71 lines that import it, mount the
production skill-packs handler, and add Vite's HMR middleware — the one thing production does
not have and the only reason the file exists. Net ~880 lines deleted.

The three "parity bugs" on the roadmap were all the same bug — a stale copy — so all three
went with it:

| was | now |
|:---|:---|
| `GET /api/prompts/:id` missing in dev; fell through to Vite and returned the SPA's HTML | serves JSON, same handler as prod |
| dev ignored `lightweight`, shipping the full library every page load | honours it and the prebuilt index — 1.28 MB vs 9.3 MB |
| dev's GitHub mode filtered the tree on `prompts/`, renamed to `library/` long ago | one GitHub implementation, the working one |

Two more divergences surfaced while collapsing them. `server.ts` had its own
`isGitHubConfigured()` that ignored `USE_GITHUB_MODE`, so a `GITHUB_TOKEN` sitting in the
environment for unrelated reasons silently flipped dev onto that broken GitHub path and
served an empty library. And `api/index.ts` split a forward-slashed prompt id on `path.sep`
in the single-prompt route — correct on Vercel, wrong on Windows, where every prompt came back
with `section` set to the entire path and `category` set to `Uncategorized`. Both fixed.

`routes/skill-packs.ts` also carried a `GET /:packId/stats` route that the production handler
never had and no frontend code calls. It was deleted rather than ported.

New: `npm run test:routes` asserts the seven expected routes are registered on the shared app,
wired into CI. Verified by running it against a deliberately wrong expectation and confirming
it fails.

---

## 2026-08-27 — A CI gate on the prompt index

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on every PR and every push to `main`, `npm ci` →
`npm run lint` → `npm run build:index`, then fail if the rebuilt index differs from the
committed one. Catches "edited the library, forgot to rebuild" at the PR instead of three
commits later.

Two fields are stripped before comparing, because neither can match by construction:
`buildTime` is stamped at each run, and `lastModified` is `stat.mtime` — a fresh CI checkout
sets that to the checkout time for *every* file, so comparing it would fail 100% of runs and
teach everyone to ignore the gate. Everything that encodes actual content is still compared,
verified by adding a throwaway library file and confirming the check goes red.

---

## 2026-08-27 — Nine more skills resynced, dead upstreams settled, model IDs swept

Three "Now" items off the roadmap in one pass.

**Nine of the ten remaining `behind` skills are now `current`** — `autoresearch`,
`interaction-design`, `academy-guide`, `python-design-patterns`, `pptx`, `find-skills`,
`skill-creator`, `golang-popular-libraries` and `matlab`. Re-running the checker:
`behind` 10 → 1, `current` 32 → 41, `upstream-gone` 6 → 0.

`pptx` was the big one. Anthropic moved the whole OOXML tree from `ooxml/` into
`scripts/office/`, so the resync pruned 59 stale files (the duplicated ISO-29500 schema set,
the old validation package, `html2pptx.js`) and wrote 56 in the new layout — a net 28k lines
deleted from the deploy root.

`x-twitter-scraper` was deliberately skipped here — its upstream ships ~60 `references/*.md`
files that are SEO landing copy ("best-x-api-alternative", "reliable-twitter-data-api-2026")
rather than skill content, and pulling them adds marketing pages to a library that already has
a payload problem. That call was overtaken: the parallel branch below (#325) pulled all 68 of
them, and the merge kept them. The skill is now `drifted` at 0% — upstream has edited the
SKILL.md since — not `behind`.

The two branches resynced overlapping sets the same day, so the entry below covers ten skills
where this one covers nine. Both landed; the union is what shipped, and the post-merge report
is [audits/upstream-drift-2026-08-27.md](audits/upstream-drift-2026-08-27.md): `behind` **0**,
`current` 41, `drifted` 52, plus 6 forks the checker now skips.

**The six dead upstreams are now marked as forks we own.** All six were re-verified against
the live upstream trees — `spreadsheet`, `sora`, `using-neon`, `gh-fix-ci`,
`git-context-controller` and `linear` really are gone (openai/plugins still ships a `linear`
plugin, but it is MCP-only now, with no `skills/` directory). Each carries
`match: fork` plus a note, and `check-upstream-drift.mjs` skips that verdict, so the weekly
job stops re-reporting six things nobody is going to fix.

**Deprecated model IDs swept** across 35 guide and agent files. Claude: `claude-3-5-sonnet`,
`claude-3-7-sonnet`, `claude-3-sonnet` → `claude-sonnet-5`; `claude-3-opus` →
`claude-opus-5`; `claude-3-haiku` → `claude-haiku-4-5`. OpenAI: `gpt-4o` → `gpt-5.6-sol`,
`gpt-4o-mini` → `gpt-5.6-luna`, verified against OpenAI's live model list.

Three scopes were left alone on purpose: `5_System_Prompts/` (an archive of what specific
models were actually shipped with — the old IDs are the point), `3_Skills/Development/API/claude-api`
(upstream-managed, and its migration docs need the old IDs), and version-history or
competitor-comparison lines like "### vs Claude 3.5". `openai_cli_guide.md` was also skipped:
it is built around GPT-4o with pricing, rate-limit and capability tables, so it needs a
rewrite rather than a find-and-replace.
## 2026-08-26 — The `behind` tier is empty

The remaining ten skills the drift report flagged as `behind` — missing more than a quarter
of their upstream's content — are now byte-identical to upstream. Verified by re-running
`check-upstream-drift.mjs` against all 99 attributed skills: `behind` 10 → **0**, `current`
32 → **42**. The verdict table no longer has a `behind` section to print.

| skill | upstream | was missing |
|:---|:---|---:|
| `Development/autoresearch` | github/awesome-copilot | 73% |
| `Design/interaction-design` | wshobson/agents | 72% |
| `Platform_Integrations/academy-guide` | anthropics/skills | 71% |
| `Development/Python/python-design-patterns` | wshobson/agents | 68% |
| `Business/Marketing/x-twitter-scraper` | xquik-dev/x-twitter-scraper | 67% |
| `Content/pptx` | anthropics/skills | 60% |
| `AI_ML/find-skills` | vercel-labs/skills | 55% |
| `Content/skill-creator` | anthropics/skills | 52% |
| `Development/golang-popular-libraries` | samber/cc-skills-golang | 31% |
| `Data/matlab` | k-dense-ai/scientific-agent-skills | 30% |

**Three of them were shipping a support tree with no SKILL.md to go with it.**
`x-twitter-scraper`, `golang-popular-libraries` and `matlab` gained 68, 4 and 20 support
files respectively — `x-twitter-scraper` was a lone `SKILL.md` in a directory whose upstream
carries 68 reference documents, so the skill named files that were never there.

**`pptx` was the reverse: a support tree from a layout that no longer exists.** Anthropic
folded the old sibling `ooxml` skill into pptx and moved its schemas from `ooxml/schemas/` to
`scripts/office/schemas/`, its validators from `ooxml/scripts/validation/` to
`scripts/office/validators/`, and dropped `html2pptx.js`, `inventory.py`, `rearrange.py` and
`replace.py` entirely. 59 local files were orphans of the old shape; 56 replaced them. Every
path the new `SKILL.md` references was checked to exist afterwards, and the same for
`skill-creator`, whose `references/output-patterns.md`, `references/workflows.md` and
`scripts/init_skill.py` are gone upstream and are referenced nowhere in the new body.

**`matlab`'s references shrank and that is an improvement.** Upstream rewrote all eight from
a generic MATLAB cheatsheet into R2026a-targeted guidance with `arguments` blocks, an
artifact-selection table and explicit "never run an untrusted project" warnings — denser
prose in fewer lines. The line count falls; the content does not.

Frontmatter is untouched as always, except the `upstream:` block: `ref` now names the commit
each skill was synced from and `checked` is today. Three skills gained a full 40-character
commit sha they did not have (36 skills now carry one, up from 33).

### The index diff is 20 lines, not 1,735

`lastModified` in `api/prompt-index.json` is the file's mtime, so rebuilding the index in a
fresh checkout rewrites it for all 1,725 prompts — churn that also makes the app's
Newest/Oldest sort meaningless. The committed index keeps the previous `lastModified` for
every file this change did not touch, so the diff is the ten resynced skills plus
`buildTime`. Prompt count is unchanged at 1,725; skill count unchanged at 323.

_Touched: 10 skill directories under `site/library/3_Skills/` (+105 files, −62, 34 changed),
`site/api/prompt-index.json`, `docs/audits/upstream-drift-2026-08-26.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`._

## 2026-08-26 — The six most-drifted skills pulled back level with upstream

The drift report shipped earlier the same day named 16 skills as `behind` — missing more
than a quarter of their upstream's content. The six worst are now `current`, verified by
re-running the same checker: `behind` 16 → 10, `current` 26 → 32.

| skill | upstream | was missing |
|:---|:---|---:|
| `Development/code-tour` | github/awesome-copilot | 91% |
| `Data/huggingface-gradio` | huggingface/skills | 86% |
| `Content/brainstorming` | obra/superpowers | 86% |
| `AI_ML/huggingface-llm-trainer` | huggingface/skills | 84% |
| `AI_ML/Agent_Development/discernment-nudge` | anthropics/skills | 77% |
| `Development/API/claude-api` | anthropics/skills | 77% |

Five of the six were stubs — a paraphrased summary of the upstream skill rather than a copy
of it. `code-tour` carried 295 words against upstream's 3,160 and none of its 20 personas or
step types. What shipped to visitors was a description of a skill, not the skill.

`claude-api` was a different failure: the body was close, but the support tree had been left
at an old layout. Anthropic split each language's single `claude-api.md` into a directory and
renamed `agent-sdk/` to `managed-agents/`, so 42 files were missing and 9 were orphans of a
structure that no longer exists. It now mirrors upstream at 68 files, and the skill-pack zip
went from 26 entries to 90.

**Frontmatter is not synced, and that is the point.** `title` carries the decorated emoji
form the site renders, and `tags`/`category`/`subcategory`/`source` are this library's own
curation — none of it exists upstream. The drift checker strips frontmatter before comparing,
so syncing the body is exactly what moves a skill from `behind` to `current`. Only the
`upstream:` block is rewritten: `ref` to the sha synced from, `checked` to today, and `match`
to `exact`, which after the sync it genuinely is.

### New tooling

`scripts/resync-upstream.mjs` is the repair half of `check-upstream-drift.mjs` and shares its
resolution logic deliberately — stamped paths come from a mirror whose layout is not the
origin repo's, so the skill is located by directory name, not by trusting the path. It
mirrors the whole upstream skill directory and prunes local files upstream no longer has
(`--keep-extra` to opt out, `--dry-run` to preview), and never writes outside the named skill
directories. Line endings follow the local `SKILL.md`, so this library stays CRLF throughout
and the separate normalization decision is not pre-empted.

`scripts/upstream.test.mjs` grew a check for the re-stamping: a resync rewrites up to 68
files, and the one thing that must survive is the block the drift checker reads next week.
It asserts no duplicated keys, `repo`/`path` preserved, curation outside the block untouched,
and idempotency.

### A number that moved

The library now mentions the current Claude 5 model family in 47 files, up from zero — all 47
inside the resynced `claude-api` tree. Nothing else in the library names a current model, so
the roadmap's "sweep deprecated model IDs" item stands; its counts are updated.

_Touched: `scripts/resync-upstream.mjs`, `scripts/upstream.test.mjs`, 6 skill directories
under `site/library/3_Skills/` (+82 files, −9), `site/api/prompt-index.json`,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/README.md`,
`docs/audits/upstream-drift-2026-08-26.md`._

## 2026-08-26 — Repository audit, security fixes, and upstream provenance

A full audit of the repo after several months idle, then the first remediation pass.
Findings and method: [audits/REPO-AUDIT-2026-08-26.md](audits/REPO-AUDIT-2026-08-26.md).

The headline is that the app was healthy — `tsc` clean, index deterministic, `main`
deployable — but two security bugs were live in production and the content pipeline did not
exist. Only 61 of 2,132 library files recorded where they came from, which is why "keep the
skills up to date" had been intractable: you cannot diff against an upstream you cannot name.

### Security

**Path traversal in the skill-download endpoint — confirmed exploitable, now closed.**
The endpoint guarded with `skillPath.startsWith('3_Skills/')` before calling
`path.join(LIBRARY_PATH, skillPath)`. That check is satisfied by `3_Skills/../../db`, so
`GET /api/skills/download/3_Skills%2F..%2F..%2Fdb` returned a 200 zip containing
`db/postgres.ts` — unauthenticated, with no middleware on the route at all. Four more
user-controlled sinks had the same shape, one of them an unauthenticated arbitrary file read.

New `site/lib/safe-path.ts` exports `resolveInside(root, rel)`: resolve first, compare
after, which is the only ordering that actually contains. All five sinks route through it.
In `api/index.ts` the check moved *above* the GitHub/filesystem split, because GitHub
normalises `..` inside `contents/` URLs too — guarding only the filesystem branch would have
left the deployed path open. Re-tested with five payloads: all `400`, legitimate skill zips
still `200`.

**Session tokens were not cryptographically random.** They came from `Math.random()`, a
non-cryptographic PRNG whose state is recoverable from observed output, and they are the
only thing authenticating a 30-day cookie — no signature, no server-side secret. Now
`randomBytes(32)`; ids use `randomBytes(6)`. Existing sessions must be purged
(`DELETE FROM user_sessions;`) because they were minted by the old generator.

**22 npm advisories to 0.** `npm audit fix` cleared 14, including two critical (`tar`,
`protobufjs`). The remaining 8 all traced to `@vercel/node`, which has no fixed release —
even 8.1.0 bundles vulnerable `undici` and `path-to-regexp`. But it was a devDependency
imported for exactly two `import type` aliases and it never executes, since Vercel supplies
the real runtime. Replaced with a 23-line `site/lib/vercel-types.ts` and removed.

**Also removed, all verified unreferenced:** `@google/genai`, `better-sqlite3` and
`@types/better-sqlite3` (superseded by the Postgres migration, still compiling a native
module on every install). Dropping `@google/genai` exposed a dead `define` in
`vite.config.ts` that inlined `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` into the client bundle — nothing
read it and it was unset, so nothing leaked, but it went before someone set the variable.
`server.ts` also stopped logging a user's email address on every My Library request.

### Upstream provenance — the freshness system

Attribution is by **content, not name**. Local skills were renamed on import
(`anthropic-brand-guidelines` vs upstream `brand-guidelines`, `docx-official` vs `docx`), so
directory matching identified only 72 of 347. Bodies survive renaming. Evidence comes from
seven directly-cloned publishers, which yield a real commit sha, plus a ~110k-skill mirror
whose paths encode the origin repo — that is what reaches the long tail of tiny publishers.

**99 of 323 skills attributed (31%), 32 with a commit sha.** The other 224 are recorded
honestly rather than guessed: 60 `ambiguous` (body present in three or more repos, so the
candidates are listed instead of one being picked) and 164 `unknown`. Both are still
stamped, because "we looked and could not tell" is a different fact from "nobody has
checked", and it stops the next person repeating the exercise.

Two rules earn most of the accuracy, and both were found by checking output rather than
trusting it:

- **First-party precedence.** A skill forked into forty repos is still its author's skill.
  Without this, `pptx`, `docx`, `xlsx` and `claude-api` were all credited to random personal
  dotfile repos that happened to sort first.
- **Path resolution, not path trust.** Mirror-derived paths follow the mirror's layout, not
  the origin repo's — it stores Anthropic's `claude-api` at `claude-api/SKILL.md` while the
  repo has it at `skills/claude-api/SKILL.md`. Taking them at face value reported **72 live
  files as deleted**; the real number is 6. The checker now fetches each repo's tree once and
  locates skills by directory name, which is also fewer API calls than fetching per file.

`check-upstream-drift.mjs` compares bodies with frontmatter stripped — local copies carry an
emoji `name:` and now an `upstream:` block, so a raw file comparison would flag all ~320
skills as drifted every week and the report would be worthless. A weekly workflow opens or
updates **one rolling issue** and never edits library content: the curation is the product,
and an auto-PR reflowing 300 files into the wrong categories would destroy it.

**First run: 16 behind, 51 drifted, 26 current, 6 upstream-gone.** It found worse than hand
inspection did — `code-tour` missing 91% of upstream, `huggingface-gradio` 86%,
`brainstorming` 86%, `claude-api` 77% plus 42 support files.

### Skill spec compliance

23 skills had no `name` and no `description`, so they could not load as skills at all — a
user downloaded the zip and got inert markdown. 171 more had a name the spec rejects,
almost always a decorative emoji prefix, and 164 had a name that did not match their
directory. **All 323 are now valid: 0 missing names, 0 missing descriptions, 0 invalid
names.**

The decorative form moved to `title:`, which is what the site renders anyway, and `name:`
became the directory slug. Paired with that, `build-prompt-index.js` and `api/index.ts` now
prefer `title` over `name` for skills — without that edit the site would have started
showing bare slugs. `server.ts` already preferred `title`, so this closed one dev/prod
divergence rather than adding another. Verified against the index before and after:
**323 in, 323 out, 265 titles unchanged, 58 improved, 0 regressed.**

Two bugs caught by checking the output, both now regression-tested:

- `description:` followed by indented continuation lines is a real multi-line YAML value but
  reads as empty. Treating it as missing and inserting a fresh `description:` orphaned the
  continuation, made the file unparseable, and silently dropped that skill from the index.
- An unquoted `name:` scalar that happens to contain quote characters lost its last
  character when quotes were stripped unconditionally.

**A correction to the audit's own claim:** moving the emoji out does *not* make skills
byte-identical to upstream. The `upstream:` block is added deliberately, so a whole-file
diff never matches again — measured 0 of 19 Anthropic skills. The drift checker strips
frontmatter anyway, so none of its verdicts change. Spec compliance was the entire payoff,
and it stands on its own.

### New tooling

| Script | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| `scripts/attribute-upstream.mjs` | Stamp `upstream:` provenance by content matching. Idempotent |
| `scripts/check-upstream-drift.mjs` | Compare every attributed skill against its upstream |
| `scripts/fix-skill-frontmatter.mjs` | Enforce the Agent Skills spec without changing the UI |
| `.github/workflows/upstream-drift.yml` | Weekly check, one rolling issue |
| `site/lib/safe-path.ts` | Path containment guard |
| Three `*.test.mjs` files | Self-checks — the repo had no tests at all before |

### Documentation

Removed the legacy tree: `docs/archive/` (17 superseded planning docs from March 2026),
`docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (it described a `prompts/` directory that no longer exists), and
`docs/library-update-logs/` (five per-section changelogs, three of them empty, all using the
pre-rename folder names). Everything is preserved in Git history. The two real entries from
those logs are folded into this file.

Fixed stale pre-rename path references across `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `templates/README.md`,
`development/DEBUG_UI.md`, `features/API.md` and `features/LIBRARY-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION.md`,
and rewrote `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s repo tree, which still described the layout from before the
app moved under `site/`.

_Touched: `site/lib/`, `site/api/index.ts`, `site/api/skill-packs.ts`, `site/server.ts`,
`site/db/postgres.ts`, `site/vite.config.ts`, `site/package.json`,
`site/scripts/build-prompt-index.js`, 323 `SKILL.md` files, `scripts/`,
`.github/workflows/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`._

## 2026-08-22 — Prompt list toolbar and grid extracted out of `App.tsx`

The last big block on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)'s `App.tsx` de-bulk list. Behavior-preserving:
the markup moved verbatim, nothing was restyled or repositioned.

**New components** — `App.tsx` **1,332 → 1,050 lines**
- `src/components/PromptListToolbar.tsx` — the header row above the prompt list: section
  title and count, the Total/Categories stat badges, the favorites / recent / tag filter
  dropdowns, and the sort `<select>`. It now owns *which* dropdown is open (one
  `openDropdown` value replacing three booleans in `App.tsx`) plus the outside-click
  handler that closes it; every filter value it edits still lives in `usePromptFilters`.
- `src/components/PromptGrid.tsx` — the main list: loading skeletons, the four empty
  states, the paginated card grid and its Previous/Next controls. Also exports
  `PromptCardGrid` (the responsive grid markup) and the `PromptCardActions` type.
- `PromptCardActions` bundles the eleven card-level props the three grids were each
  drilling into `PromptCard` by hand — featured, all-prompts and subcategory now pass one
  memoized object. Featured keeps its `lg:grid-cols-4` layout via `columns="featured"`.
- `App.tsx` shed three `useState` hooks, one `useEffect`, the local `cn()` helper (and its
  `clsx` / `tailwind-merge` imports), the now-unused `PromptCard` and `EmptyState`
  imports, and four `lucide-react` icons (`Tag`, `Star`, `ChevronDown`, `ChevronRight`).

**Scope note.** The roadmap item named one file, `PromptGrid.tsx`. It became two because
the featured section renders *between* the toolbar and the grid — folding the toolbar into
`PromptGrid` would have meant passing the featured block through as a slot, which is more
indirection than the split it was meant to avoid.

**Docs caught up while here** — `docs/features/FEATURED-PROMPTS.md` still showed a
`featuredPrompts` snippet that filtered `sortedPrompts` on the `featured` tag alone. The
real memo reads `sectionPrompts`, counts favorites as featured, and falls back to the four
most recently modified prompts so the row is never empty.

_Touched: `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/PromptGrid.tsx`,
`src/components/PromptListToolbar.tsx`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,
`docs/features/FEATURED-PROMPTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`._

## 2026-08-19 — Weekly trending-skills sweep

Added 5 skills:

- **discernment-nudge** (`3_Skills/AI_ML/Agent_Development/discernment-nudge`) — [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/discernment-nudge/SKILL.md)
- **academy-guide** (`3_Skills/Platform_Integrations/academy-guide`) — [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/academy-guide/SKILL.md)
- **text-to-cad** (`3_Skills/Development/text-to-cad`) — [earthtojake/text-to-cad](https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad)
- **design-award-evaluation** (`3_Skills/Design/design-award-evaluation`) — SeanJ1ang/design-judge-skills *(upstream has since been deleted)*
- **diagram-design** (`3_Skills/Design/diagram-design`) — [cathrynlavery/diagram-design](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design)

## 2026-08-18 — Top bar extracted out of `App.tsx`

Next item on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)'s `App.tsx` de-bulk list. Behavior-preserving: the
markup moved verbatim, nothing was restyled or repositioned.

**New components** — `App.tsx` **1,393 → 1,332 lines**
- `src/components/TopBar.tsx` — the header row above the content area: mobile sidebar
  trigger, `ResourcesNav`, and the logged-in/logged-out auth controls. Takes the current
  user plus four callbacks; holds no state of its own.
- `src/components/LibraryHero.tsx` — the section heading and library search field shown
  whenever no prompt or subcategory is selected. `searchQuery` still lives in
  `usePromptFilters`, passed down as a controlled value.
- `App.tsx` dropped its now-dead `ResourcesNav` import and four unused `lucide-react`
  icons (`Search`, `Menu`, `Library`, `Trash2`) plus an unused `extractEmoji` import.

**Scope note.** The roadmap item also listed the sort control and the library-mode switcher
as part of the top bar. Neither is: the library-mode switcher already lives in
`Sidebar.tsx`, and the sort `<select>` belongs to the prompt-list toolbar, so it travels
with the `PromptGrid.tsx` extraction instead. Moving either into the header would have been
a redesign, not an extraction.

**Docs caught up while here** — all three described the pre-extraction shape
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s component tree listed a `Header`/`ViewToggle`/`PromptList` structure
  that never shipped; it now names the actual component files.
- `docs/features/LIBRARY-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` pointed at `App.tsx` line numbers that rotted
  through two extraction rounds — now symbol/file pointers, and the switcher is correctly
  attributed to `Sidebar.tsx`.
- `docs/features/API.md` said the page size is configurable in `App.tsx`; it is
  `ITEMS_PER_PAGE` in `src/hooks/usePromptFilters.ts`.

_Touched: `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/TopBar.tsx`, `src/components/LibraryHero.tsx`,
`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/features/LIBRARY-MODE-IMPLEMENTATION.md`,
`docs/features/API.md`, `CLAUDE.md`._

## 2026-08-18 — Audit follow-through: rename drift, index correctness, App.tsx de-bulk

Working through the June 2026 project audit (removed 2026-08-26; see Git history).
The metadata items were mostly already done; verifying them surfaced four live bugs, all
from the `Skills/` → `3_Skills/` folder rename never reaching the backend.

**Index correctness** — public library **3,826 → 1,722** prompts, `api/prompt-index.json` **2.4 MB → 1.06 MB**
- `Legacy/` was being indexed and shipped to every browser: **1,705 entries** (45% of the payload)
  tagged `section: "Legacy"`, which no tab maps to — so they were undisplayable dead weight.
  Now skipped in `build-prompt-index.js`, `api/index.ts` (filesystem + GitHub walks) and `server.ts`.
- The "only index `SKILL.md`" rule still tested the pre-rename `Skills/` path, so **421 skill
  sub-files** (`examples/`, `references/`, `agents/`) were listed in the Skills tab as if they
  were skills. Skills tab now shows the correct **320**.
- Same stale name made `isSkill` always false, so skills used `title:` instead of their `name:`
  frontmatter field.
- Dev and prod disagreed on all of the above — `server.ts` had been updated for the rename,
  `api/index.ts` and the index builder had not.

**Reliability**
- **One malformed frontmatter file emptied the entire Public Library.** An unguarded `matter()`
  call in `server.ts` / `api/index.ts` threw and the handler returned `[]`. Bad files are now
  logged and skipped, matching the index builder. Fixed the 4 offending files at the source
  (broken quoting in `title:`), recovering 4 prompts.
- **Prompt ids are now always forward-slashed.** `path.relative` emits backslashes on Windows,
  so every tab filter (`id.startsWith('4_Prompts/')`) failed and local dev showed 0 prompts.
- **A missing/unreachable `DATABASE_URL` no longer crashes the dev server.** `initializeSchema()`
  threw before `app.listen`, so a fresh clone couldn't run the app at all — contradicting the
  documented "runs read-only without a database" behavior. It now warns and serves the
  Public Library.

**`App.tsx` de-bulk** — **2,845 → 1,393 lines**, ~40 → 27 `useState` hooks
- Extracted earlier: `ResourcesNav`, `Sidebar`, `PromptCard`, `PromptDetail`.
- New `src/hooks/usePromptFilters.ts`: owns search + debounce, tag filter, sort, and pagination
  plus everything derived from them. The five hardcoded per-tab path checks collapse into one
  `TAB_PATH_PREFIX` lookup.

**Metadata**
- `package.json` version `0.0.0` → `1.0.0`; `.env.example` referenced a `prompts/` directory
  that no longer exists.

_Touched: `src/App.tsx`, `src/hooks/usePromptFilters.ts`, `api/index.ts`, `server.ts`,
`scripts/build-prompt-index.js`, `api/prompt-index.json`, `package.json`, `.env.example`,
4 library files._

## 2026-04-29 — My Library, Skill Packs & search

**My Library actions**
- Added explicit **Remove from My Library** controls in card/detail views; clarified delete labels.

**Prompt add/copy**
- Fixed post-add refresh that could blank the list until reload; unified on a lightweight fetch with safer response handling.

**Skill Packs — public vs my library**
- Skill Packs now respect `library=public|my` in frontend and backend.
- New install-tracking table `user_skill_pack_installs`; My Library shows only packs the user added, Public shows the full catalog.
- Explicit add/remove lifecycle with confirm dialogs:
  - `POST /api/skill-packs/:packId/add-to-library`
  - `DELETE /api/skill-packs/:packId/remove-from-library`
- Imported skills tagged `skill-pack:<packId>` so removal cleans up every skill from that pack.

**Prompt creation**
- Create-Prompt section dropdown matches the app taxonomy (`1_Guides`…`5_System_Prompts`); new prompts force My Library mode; default section `4_Prompts`.

**Search**
- Ranking prioritizes title matches: starts-with → contains → other (tags/category/content).

_Touched: `src/App.tsx`, `PromptEditorModal.tsx`, `SkillPacksView.tsx`, `routes/skill-packs.ts`, `api/skill-packs.ts`, `db/postgres.ts`, `api/prompt-index.json`._

## 2026-03-28 — Agent frontmatter template compliance

Enforced the agent template's frontmatter requirements (`title`, `tags`, `category`,
`subcategory`) across `library/2_Agents/`, starting with 10 files in AI Engineering and MCP.
Existing `name`, `description`, `tools` and `model` fields were preserved.

The 2026-08-26 audit revisited this: 457 of 547 files in `2_Agents` still have no `name:` or
`description:`, so they cannot load as subagents at all. See the roadmap for the open
question of what that section should actually be.

---

## 2026-03-25 — Performance pass + content expansion

**Performance** (the library had grown to ~1,400 files and was freezing cold starts and the browser)
- **Prebuilt prompt index** (`scripts/build-prompt-index.js` → `api/prompt-index.json`): metadata + 200-char previews generated at build time. Cold start **2–5s → <100ms**.
- **Lightweight mode** (`?lightweight=true`): preview-only payloads, full content lazy-loaded. Initial payload **13MB → 278KB**.
- **`GET /api/prompts/:id`**: fetch a single prompt with full content (file-based or DB).
- **Pagination** at 50/page: DOM elements **1,427 → 50**, memory ~200MB → ~20MB. Resets to page 1 on filter change. (Adjustable in `src/App.tsx`.)
- **File-size filter**: skip files >500KB during index build (excludes two multi-MB bulk collections).
- **5-minute in-memory cache** for public-library lightweight requests.

**Content**
- 7 new MCP-server prompt collections (~135 prompts): GitHub, Playwright, Serper, Google Workspace, n8n, Supabase, Firebase.
- Featured prompts refreshed toward developer roles (21 total); contextual emojis added.

**Fixes / maintenance**
- Converted new MCP files from comma-string tags to YAML arrays (fixed `tags.forEach is not a function`).
- Added missing `#` headings to 3 `SKILL.md` files.
- Renamed `Mcp_Servers/` → `MCP_Servers/` for consistent acronym casing.

> Folder names above (`Prompt_Library/…`) reflect the pre-rename layout; the library has
> since moved to the numbered `1_Guides`…`5_System_Prompts` scheme.

the same time._
