# Discovery ledger

GitHub repos that `scripts/discover-repos.mjs` found and that the library might vendor or link:
skills, prompt collections, agent definitions and MCP servers that are **new** (created in the
last year with 500+ stars) or **popular** (5000+ stars) and that nothing here already tracks.
The weekly **Prompt-Library Discovery** job (`jobs\prompt-library-discovery` in the Routines
fleet, Tuesdays) appends rows and opens a `discovery/auto-*` PR; a person changes **Status**.

| Status | Meaning | Who acts |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `pending` | Found, not decided | Mike |
| `accept` | Vendor its content with provenance (or, for `mcp`, write a card) | the Catalog Refresh job |
| `link` | Worth a Resources-menu link, nothing to vendor | `discover-repos.mjs --write` |
| `reject` | Not for this library (stays here so it is not found again) | nobody |
| `done` | Content vendored, or an MCP card written; the catalog job sets this | nobody |

Rules the catalog job follows on an `accept` row: read the licence that run (a row that says
`none` is never vendored, only linked); copy at most 6 files per repo per run, each with an
`upstream:` block (`repo`, `path`, `ref`, `checked`, `match: exact`) and `tags`; skills go to
`3_Skills/<Category>/<Sub>/`, prompts to `4_Prompts/`, agent definitions to `2_Agents/`, in the
neighbours' format. An `mcp` row becomes one card in `site/library/6_MCP_Servers/`, written from
`docs/templates/mcp-servers-template.md` with install lines read from its README that run. Then
set the row to `done` and note what was taken.

First triage, 2026-10-21: the 25 rows of the first run plus the three seed rows. Skills
collections with a licence were accepted, apps and agent harnesses rejected, licence-less or
tool-only lists linked, and three MCP servers written up straight away.

Columns: repo, kind (`skills` / `prompts` / `agents` / `mcp`), stars when found, licence key,
last push, date found, status, note. Newest rows at the top. The script dedupes on the repo
column, so never delete a row: change its status instead.
